1,All sense of time and space is lost as you plunge headlong into the whirling black throat of the abyss. Only a numbing chill and a mournful sound, like a million voices crying in despair, accompany you on your descent into the unknown. Gradually your mind is filled with fearful visions, nightmare shapes that reach out of the darkness to claw and bite and scream at your passing. They grow in menace until they are swiftly dispelled by diamond-shaped motes of light, which streak past at incredible speeds. The tiny lights engulf you in a cone of fiery brilliance and a metallic smell of ozone, sharp and pungent, assails your nostrils. A sensation of warmth surges through your frozen limbs. Then, an instant later, you strike solid ground with such a suddenness that you are left stunned and panting for breath.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> (if you pick 0 it counts as 10). The number you have picked represents the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you have lost during your passage through the Shadow Gate. Adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.

2,You throw the Fireseed against the wall of the tomb and it bursts into flame, showering the Chaos-creatures with splinters of stone and motes of red fire. Now they screech and squeal and rip each other to pieces in their panic to avoid the searing flames. The Fireseed has saved you from their initial attack but you sense that it is just a temporary reprieve. The whole area is saturated with hundreds of their kind and if you stay here you will be overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Reluctantly you are forced back to the Grand Sepulchre and the three tentacled horrors that command its entrance.

34,
3,Using your Kai skill you command the sinister reptilian to halt and return to its lair. Immediately, the rustle of its scaly body ceases: it is losing interest now that it can no longer detect your scent. It turns and slithers away, and you hurry up the stairs towards the surface.

70,
4,You leave Serocca's chamber and follow T'uk T'ron as he leads you out of the tower and along a busy street towards the city's main square. Three gleaming bronze chariots, each drawn by a team of strange, horse-like creatures called onipa, are ready and waiting to take you to Tolakos. With the Ookor captain you climb aboard the leading chariot and grab the hand-rail as its driver cracks his whip. The onipa surge forward and, in a cloud of thick dust, the chariots race out of the city and along a stony road that cuts through the centre of the valley beyond.Three hours pass before you catch sight of a village on the road ahead. T'uk T'ron grins and points repeatedly at his open mouth. ‘You want eat here?' he says, shouting to make himself heard above the incessant rattling of the chariot wheels.

124,If you wish to stop at the Ookor village for a meal, 
258,If you wish to press on to Tolakos without stopping, 
5,Your new scout's name is Arke, a wiry Meledorian with steely grey hair and a lean, scraggy face. He is an expert woodsman and with his help you are able to avoid all contact with marauding remnants of the chaos-horde. The journey to the edge of the Plain of Guakor takes nearly 100 hours, during which time you are able to conserve your food supplies by living off the land. In fact, so bountiful is the Nahgoth Forest that you are able to gather a surplus of food equivalent to 3 Meals (if you wish to keep any of this surplus food, adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly).You share a meal with Arke and bid him farewell (you do not need to erase a Meal from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). Then you check your equipment and consult your map before setting off with trepidation across the barren Plain of Guakor.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

6,Puzzled by its purpose, you step back from the monolith in order to look at it in its entirety. You have taken less than a dozen steps when you hear the rustle of foliage: you are not alone.

7,Filling the alcoves and lying on tables of solid silver in the centre of the vault are huge piles of jewels, precious metals, and artefacts of breathtaking beauty. Never have you seen a wealth to rival the hoard surrounding you here. Open-mouthed you wander between the tables, sifting and examining those objects that outshine the vivid brilliance of the rest. One unique item in particular fires your admiration—a mighty broadsword set with rubies, emeralds, and polished korlinium. Its size and weight are perfectly balanced, and, as you raise it above your head, it hums with a potent magical force locked within its mirror-bright blade.If you wish to keep this Ironheart Broadsword, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry strapped across your back.
1
251,
8,You raise the sword and essay a cut or two to assess its worth. It is a fine weapon, skilfully crafted by an expert smith. Its hilt is bejewelled with emeralds and the curvy blade is engraved with a spectacular fiery dragon. At once you recognize the design and your hopes of retrieving the last Lorestone are revived. It is identical to the symbol you first saw in the Table of Visions: the mark that emblazoned the stone gate of Haagadar.You focus your Kai skills on the blade and they confirm your suspicions. The scarlet warrior came from Haagadar, and it is to that distant city that his black-winged mount is now returning with the last Lorestone of Nyxator.

246,
9,You search for a solution that will break the spell of holding that secures the door, but your senses tell you that you lack the means to overcome this alien magic. Reluctantly you turn your back on the door and consider your next course of action.
2
170,If you wish to investigate the adjoining room, 
219,If you choose to remain in the room, 
10,The hack of weapons and the ghastly howls of the attacking Chaos-creatures grow louder. The battle noise, especially the dying screams of the Ookor, play upon your mind as you run for the safety of the hills. When eventually you reach the first ridge, you look back at the bridge guiltily in the hope of seeing T'uk T'ron and his guards victorious. But your hope is in vain, for the only creatures alive and triumphant are the grey horde now feasting ghoulishly on the slain.Remorse clouds your mind and your senses give no forewarning of the menace skulking nearby. From behind a moss-covered boulder emerge six hideous monstrosities, crouched and snarling, each with the fire of chaos burning in their evil eyes. With a blood-curdling yowl they fall upon you and drag you to your knees.These creatures are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Owing to the surprise and ferocity of their attack, you are unable to unsheathe a weapon and must fight the first two rounds of combat unarmed.
1
114,If you win the combat, 
11,The pain fades but it is replaced by a fearful numbness that drains the strength from your limbs. Odel's face and the canopy of dense branches swirl and grow dim as the toxins of the deadly orange Khetu Spore buds poison your blood. You sink into a deep sleep—a sleep from which you will never awaken.
0
12,Hastily you tip your provisions onto the wet, flagstoned floor and run up the stairs as fast as your legs will carry you. Your quick thinking pays off: the gigantic sewer snake stops to consume your food, enabling you to escape.

13,Drawing on your Kai skill you command the waking reptilian to close its eyes and go back to sleep. But the creature is ravenously hungry and, despite your success at masking your body scent, it begins to edge forward in preparation for attack.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 1 point to this number for every Magnakai Discipline you possess.

271,If your total is now 8 or less, 
199,If it is 9 or more, 
14,You inscribe the symbol and suddenly a blast of cold vapour hits you squarely in the face. You choke and retch as the bitter, poisonous gas seeps into your lungs.

223,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, 
99,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
15,The scouts spin on their heels to face you, raising their forearms in reflex action at your sudden appearance. ‘Hold it!' snaps one of them to his companions, who are both on the verge of firing their weapons. ‘He could be the one.'Warily they approach and demand that you identify yourself. You tell them who you are and suggest that they look in your pocket if they require proof that you speak the truth. Gingerly, one steps forward.

87,
16,The stumpy little Ookor takes a rapid step backwards when you tell him you do not come from Meledor. Nervously his followers close around him and raise their spears, forming a defensive wall to protect their leader. You assure them that you mean no harm and try to explain how you arrived in their land, but fear and suspicion cloud their eyes until you mention Serocca, the name of the one whose help you seek.‘Very well,' says L'yan-K'ril, pensively. ‘We will take you to Serocca, if that is truly your wish.'

35,
17,Desperately he tries to avoid your Arrow but it penetrates his armour and lodges in the side of his neck. He screams at the sudden pain and tears the offending shaft from his flesh, hurling it back at you contemptuously. Such fortitude is impressive but you can tell that he has suffered a serious wound. Feverishly he scoops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack which hangs from his sword belt, and you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon as you run forward to prevent his escape.

206,
18,Sagely the old Ookor nods her head and retrieves her cards from the table. She bows, and as she turns she mumbles something in her native tongue, before shuffling away to help her daughters gather the empty food bowls.‘She say it sometimes better for warrior not to know his future,' says T'uk T'ron, and rounds off his meal with a hearty belch. ‘We go now, yes?' You nod and the little Ookor captain orders his company back to the chariots.As you prepare to leave you notice the old fortune teller waiting near the door of the hut. She has something in her hand and, as you approach, she offers it to you. It is a large, wooden charm shaped like the wing of a bird. If you wish to keep this Ookor Charm, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep strapped to your Backpack.With a wave, you bid farewell to the cheerful villagers and hurry back to your chariot.

117,
19,Your Arrow grazes the creature's eye then ricochets off its horny lid. The sudden unexpected pain sends the creature into the sky, screeching an agonized cry across the empty plain. Then it turns and flies away to seek the shelter of its lair and nurse its weeping wound.

265,
20,With dread anticipation you stagger to your feet to survey your new surroundings. A bleak and desolate plateau, seemingly devoid of life, stretches into the distance on all sides. Jagged boulders litter a desert of crimson sand, which is stirred to restless motion by fierce and scorching winds. Neither sun nor moon hang in the amber skies above, yet their absence does not leave this world in darkness, for all along the horizon blazes a fire which glows brighter than a thousand sunsets. You stare across this alien landscape and a feeling of helplessness grips your senses as you realize where you have emerged. This is the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.A knot of fear tightens in your stomach as you recall what little you have heard about this world. The magicians of Sommerlund believe it to be an astral corridor that connects Magnamund with other planes of existence. So, by passing through a Shadow Gate, one of which is situated below the Guildhall in Toran, a person can gain entry to the Daziarn. However, those who have passed through the Shadow Gate in Toran have never been seen again and the magicians believe that the journey can be made in only one direction. They say there is no escape from the Daziarn.Your vow to restore the Kai and your stubborn will to survive against all odds refuse to let you believe that there is no way back to your home world. You cast aside your fear and steel yourself for the task of finding a means of escaping from this desolate place. But firstly you must recover the two Lorestones that fell into the Shadow Gate shortly before you.

145,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and have reached the Kai rank of Tutelary or higher, 
297,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
21,Your Arrow is well aimed and deadly effective. It enters the creature's mouth, skewers its heart, and sends it spinning wildly into the trees amid a spray of foul green blood. Without waiting to discover if it was the only one of its kind, you shoulder your Bow and hurry away from the clearing.
1
138,
22,For his size the warrior is as quick as a cat. At your approach he draws a curvy-bladed sword and prepares to greet you with its razor-sharp edge. You strike first, aiming a blow at his head, but he dodges it and moves continually, presenting you with a hard target to hit. You strike again and this time he parries your blow and turns it back with such strength that you are sent reeling to the edge of the roof.
2
306,If you reduce his <small>ENDURANCE</small> to 20 points or less, do not continue the combat but 
123,If you kill him before his <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 20 points (that is, if you score an ‘automatically killed' result on the Combat Results Table), 
23,‘I perceive much in your character that pleases me, human. You possess inner strength, honour, and a fiery courage uncommon among the mortals of Aon. Were it not for these traits I would have no hesitation in ridding myself of you, for I will not tolerate the weak and untrustworthy in my realm.'He pauses for a moment and gazes fixedly at the shapes swirling near the centre of the room. ‘I have looked into your mind and the reasons why you are here in the Daziarn are now known to me. The quests and struggles of Magnamund are of no significance to the Shining City, but there are those of this world who would rejoice to learn that the last of the Kai is here, if only to seek you out and destroy you. For this reason you must leave Yanis. But I shall not send you away without guidance, for you have my respect and I shall help you all I can.'

They each dwarf you by an arm's length and, although their heavy, muscular bodies seem incapable of stealth, they approach the cairn with animal grace.<i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Zeeu klo-ka kilkora dau Ztuul n'ra?'</i> speaks the leader, his voice deep and resonant. <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Ryl'aan noorna?'</i> says the being by his side, his eyes blazing like twin discs of amber flame.

252,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the rank of Scion-kai, 
280,If you do not possess this Magnakai Discipline or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
27,As you look down from the parapet you are greeted by a stirring sight. Lorkon Ironheart's army is surging into Tolakos, transforming the chaos-choked grounds into a raging battlefield. At their head you see Lorkon, his silver armour and scarlet cloak tarnished with black blood, striking at the enemy with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. He leads a massive wedge of Meledorian warriors whose faces and armour are painted with magical runes to ward off the creatures of chaos. The Agtah melt before them, like ice before a fire, and flee in panic to the dark safety of the Nahgoth. The Meledorians give a rousing cheer of victory to speed the enemy's retreat. But their jubilant cries are soon stifled when, from the depths of the forest, they are answered by a thunderous roar.

28,In the centre of each clump of herbs rests a cluster of large, acorn-shaped buds, which exude the sweet pungent aroma that hangs heavily in the air.

316,If you do not possess <em>both</em> these skills, 
30,The ghostly spirit-shapes possess the faces of every enemy you have ever slain. They twist and contort beneath your gaze, their empty eyes burning with cold blue flames as they return your stare. You press your fists to your eyes and scream in an effort to block out this haunting nightmare, but to no avail. It saps your strength and numbs you to the bone: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

175,
31,A thick, sinuous tail whips out from the rear of the creature's scaly body and slams into the cavern wall above your head, gouging a deep furrow in the friable rock. Before it can lash out a second time you unsheathe a hand weapon and strike at its vulnerable eyes.
1
245,If you win the combat, 
32,You draw an Arrow and take aim as he stoops to snatch the Lorestones with his gloved hands. But he is covered in heavy mail and, even at such close range, there are few places where you can be sure that your Arrow will pierce his armour.
3
76,If you wish to fire at his visor, 
151,If you wish to fire at his throat, 
333,If you wish to fire at his chest, 
33,There is a shrieking squeal as the wheels lock and the chariot slews violently across the road. The driver fights to control his team by pulling on the reins with all his strength, but the heavy leather straps are caught among the traces and the onipa do not respond: the chariot is out of control. Desperately you cling to the hand-rail as one wheel rises and the platform begins to tilt.

85,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
299,If you do not possess this skill, you can leap from the chariot: 
243,Or you can hold on tight and pray that the driver will regain control of the onipa team: 
34,You race back across the graveyard and charge headlong into the three creatures blocking the entrance. They bellow and growl as your first blows find their way between their plates of armour. Quickly they retaliate by lashing at you with their long, suckered tentacles. Their attacks are ill-aimed and clumsy, but wherever one of their rubbery limbs touches your body it leaves an angry red weal.Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, add 2 to any <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses you sustain during this combat, owing to the poisonous lash of their tentacles.
1
133,If you win the combat, 
35,For several hours you accompany the Ookor across a vast tract of grassland, featureless save for a narrow trail and a line of low hills, which rest on the horizon like a sleeping colossus. During the trek you become very hungry: you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Eventually the trail ascends to the peak of the hills and, as you clear the crest, you see a remarkable sight beyond.

222,
36,You sense immediately that the tiny orange growths are poisonous Khetu Spore pods. If swallowed, or if the spores are allowed to infect the bloodstream, the toxin can kill in a matter of minutes.If you wish to collect a handful of these Khetu Spores, mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.

247,
37,No sooner has the snarling Agtah dropped lifelessly from your arm than another slams against your back and sends you sprawling face first into the mud. You twist yourself free of its grip and aim a blow at its glistening green head, but its reactions are as fast as yours and your blow cleaves nothing but a furrow in the dark earth. It springs forward once more; you pull up your legs and kick out at its chest, catch it squarely and ram the foul air from its lungs. It howls and lands heavily, but it is back on its feet to meet your next attack.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).

308,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility, 
259,If you do not possess this skill, 
39,You tug the Silver Rod from your belt and hold it before you. A look of surprise widens the leader's eyes but his shock soon turns to anger when he realizes where you obtained the silvery wand. He bellows his contempt for your act of grave-robbery and, in a fit of rage, he releases from his rod a charge of raw power.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

191,If your total is now 3 or more, 
328,If it is 2 or less, 
40,Something huge and deadly is striding towards Tolakos. The ground trembles beneath its step and the air is filled with sounds of great destruction. The crack and groan of sundered trees and the thunderous growls of a gigantic beast grow steadily louder, driving many of Lorkon's soldiers to the brink of despair. Desperately he tries to rally them but his voice is lost in the deafening noise.Suddenly a gap appears at the forest's edge as, effortlessly, a pair of stout trees are pushed apart by monstrous hands. Morbid terror grips the Meledorians and few stand their ground when they see the awesome visage of the Chaos-master looming thirty feet above. You look upon his massive, naked body and feel sickened by what you see. His features are in a constant state of flux, dissolving, merging, and melting into new and ever more hideous shapes. Only Lorkon appears unmoved by the dreadful sight; he raises his sword and challenges the evil being to single combat, but his brave words are met with a howl of derision.‘You would challenge a god?' speaks the Chaos-master, his mocking voice unbearably loud. Lorkon remains undaunted by his enemy and repeats his call to combat. The Chaos-master laughs. ‘Ha! Then let us begin, for though our sport shall be but a brief affair, I will delight in killing such a righteous fool as thou, Lorkon.'With terrifying ease the Chaos-master uproots a tree, pares away the branches with the edge of his hand, and then wields it like a gigantic club. He strides forward, pursuing Lorkon in a grim game of cat and mouse that leaves a trail of destruction wherever they go. The Meledorian relies on luck and fleetness of foot to avoid the crushing blows, but his luck and skill do not last indefinitely. He slips and falls near the wall of the crypt on the roof of which you are crouching. The Chaos-master bellows with glee and strides forward, his club raised to crush Lorkon to an unrecognizable pulp. His loathsome shoulders draw level with the parapet and, as he steadies himself for the <i xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>, he comes within an arm's length of your position.

204,If you possess the Ironheart Broadsword, 
111,If you do not possess either of these Special Items, 
41,The shadowy riders raise their black hands, and spears of blue fire appear suddenly in their fists. They scream an unearthly cry as they brandish these crackling lances; then they level them at your chest and charge forward to ride you down.You cannot evade combat and must fight the supernatural creatures to the death.
1
149,If you win the combat, 
42,A soft, whirring noise emanates from inside the lock, and then silently and effortlessly the great portal swings open. With your nerves on edge you enter the dark interior and follow a featureless corridor to another large but less impressive door, which opens at your approach. A surge of damp air whips past you, sucked into the chamber beyond, as the airtight seal is broken after many decades. Torches ignite spontaneously and, for the first time in its long history, the secrets of the inner sanctum of the Great Sepulchre are revealed to the eyes of an Aonian.
1
54,
43,Unable to make the beam move, you decide to climb out of the hole and look further along the bridge for some other means of effecting a repair. As you rise to your feet you hear a noise that makes you freeze: it is the sound of an evil, snickering laugh.
2
92,If you have the Magnakai Disciplines of Divination <em>and</em> Huntmastery, 
316,If you do not possess <em>both</em> these skills, 
44,The markings are letters, although the strange script is unlike any you have seen before. All you can discern is that this is an epitaph to a creature named ‘Ztuul' who lies buried inside the cairn.
1
260,
45,Your Arrow strikes his chest at an acute angle and glances off to splinter harmlessly against the parapet of the roof. He utters a mocking laugh, his cat-like eyes glinting through the slits in his visor, and hurriedly he drops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack which hangs from his sword belt. Angered by his laugh, and your failure, you shoulder your Bow and draw a hand weapon as you rush forward, determined to prevent his escape.
1
22,
46,You manage to fell three charioteers before you are trampled and crushed to death beneath the flailing hooves and heavy wheels of the following Ookor chariot teams.
0
47,As you strike the fatal blow, the Chaos-master vents a shriek loud enough to wake the dead. His great body stiffens and his skin writhes and shimmers, making it impossible to discern any detail. Then he fades until all that remains to record his existence is the lingering smell of his spilt blood.
1
232,
48,By magnifying your vision you are able to see that the middle of the bridge is damaged. Many of the planks have been torn up and strewn across the surface at random, crudely disguising the gaping hole. You scream a warning to T'uk T'ron and he is able to halt the chariots just in time, as they thunder towards the approach ramp.
2
69,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the rank of Tutelary or higher, 
196,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
49,Desperately you dive aside to avoid the searing gout of smoky yellow flame that pours from the Zhengha's mouth. Your lightning reactions save you from a roasting and, as you roll to your feet, you are able to unsheathe a weapon and advance on the beast unobserved.

329,
50,The shining City of Yanis lies before you, rising in circular levels around a turreted citadel of sparkling crystal which dominates the vast, alien metropolis. Constructed out of sheeted platinum, silver, glass, and mirrored steel, it reflects the light in a thousand colours from its walls, windows, and huge, conical towers, giving it the appearance and splendour of a glowing sun. As the dragonmount glides over the outer walls, you feast your eyes upon a network of broad avenues lined with fragrant, tree-like plants, squares with fountains, and huge, silver, bell-shaped dwellings.Directly ahead stands the citadel. The leader signals once more and together the Yoacor land their winged steeds upon a glassy platform adjacent to one of the citadel's five circular watchtowers. There you are met by Yoacor guards, resplendent in armour of burnished silver, who attend to the dragonmounts with dutiful efficiency. The leader helps you dismount before dismissing his company and escorting you to a room in the watchtower.<i>You will rest here,</i> he says, using only his mind. <i>I shall take word to the Beholder and he shall speak with you. Refresh yourself and sleep if you wish.</i> He motions towards an adjoining room then turns and leaves, the door closing behind him seemingly of its own accord.

170,If you wish to investigate the adjoining room, 
340,If you wish to attempt an escape from the watchtower, 
219,If you choose to remain in this room, 
51,The vision of your maker shatters with breathtaking suddenness and, without any warning, you fall forwards and plummet into thick, swirling cloud. The scary sensation of this rapid descent leaves you gasping, but the initial shock is soon replaced by the calm certainty that your fall is being controlled by unseen hands. Then, as if awaking from a dream, you become aware that the cloud has faded and the welcome feel of firm ground has returned beneath your feet.You stand at the foot of a massive sandstone cliff, its sheer wall pitted and scarred by fierce winds that whip across the surrounding rocky landscape. Perched at the top of the cliff is a walled city, whose grim outline and dragon gate you recognize immediately: it is Haagadar, the forgotten city of the Sandai. You stare up at the stronghold, pondering the near-impossible climb to its gate, and try to suppress your mounting fears. Nearby you see a stinking stream of foul water. You follow it to its source and discover that it pours from a grille set into the cliff wall. It must be a sewage channel that services the city above.
2
140,If you wish to attempt to enter the city via the sewage channel, 
244,If you wish to try to climb the sheer, windswept cliff to the city gate, 
52,One of the scouts turns his head and answers your mind-call out loud. ‘Show yourself!' he orders, much to the surprise of his two companions, who possess no psychic skill and did not hear your telepathic message. You emerge from the foliage, your hands held open and away from your body. The other two spin round to face you, raising their forearms in reflex action at your sudden appearance.‘Hold it!' snaps the telepath to his companions, who are both on the verge of firing their bows. ‘He is the one.'They seem unimpressed by his judgement and refuse to lower their bows until you suggest that one of them looks in your pocket if it is proof of your identity they require.

53,For countless hours you follow the stream without seeing a soul. You are beginning to suspect that this land is completely devoid of intelligent life when you happen upon a series of long, level fields, planted in precise rows with sweet-smelling yellow herbs. A path runs up from the stream to the brow of a hill.
2
28,If you wish to stop and examine this field of herbs, 
115,If you decide to follow the path to the top of the hill, 
54,At the centre of the chamber stands the statue of a proud Meledorian warrior, clad in battle-dress and with his sword raised in challenge. Seven closed caskets lie at his feet with seven more beside them, open and empty, awaiting future generations of the Ironheart clan. Here you can sense the presence of the Lorestones more strongly: your skin tingles and your pulse begins to race. But, despite your reactions, you can tell that they lie not within this chamber but somewhere nearby.Behind the tall statue you discover a narrow stair that ascends to a circular portal in the ceiling. Close to the foot of the stairs there is an arched door of sparkling blue metal.

107,If you possess the Sommerswerd, 
221,If you do not possess this Special Item, 
55,Tolakos is fast being overrun by the chaos-horde and there are few places left in which to hide. To your left you see the domed roof and vine-covered walls of the Crypt of Juilor; to your right lies the damp grey Vault of Sedron; and behind you is the tall, flat-topped Tomb of Baylon.

272,If you wish to hide in the Crypt of Juilor, 
331,If you wish to hide in the Vault of Sedron, 
166,If you wish to hide in Baylon's Tomb, 
56,You back away from the dead giant's body, your weapon held ready to continue the fight should the remaining Yoacor thirst for revenge. But they seem unmoved by their champion's death and show no desire to avenge it. The leader regards you with a cold smile of approval, for you have triumphed honourably in single combat and, by doing so, earned his admiration. He holds you with his eyes and projects a psychic message using a mind language you can understand.<i>We are the Yoacor</i> he says, telepathically. <i>We are the Lords of Yanis—the Shining City—and masters of the Abaxial of Czenos. Come, esteemed warrior; I invite you to join us. Come to Yanis where you will enjoy the rewards of the brave.</i>He beckons you to accompany him to his dragonmount. At first you hesitate, fearful of their intentions, but the thought of being left marooned in this inhospitable wilderness soon persuades you to accept the Yoacor's invitation.

205,
57,Suddenly the wheels jam in a deep furrow and the chariot flips forward, catapulting you over the hand-rail to land with a thick splash in the mud at the river's edge. Stunned and blinded on impact, you do not see the onipa break free of their traces and come racing down the bank towards you until it is too late to avoid them. Pain explodes in your head as their iron-shod hooves descend on you like a rain of hammers. They inflict terrible wounds but death is mercifully quick.
0
58,Cautiously you pass through the opening and follow Serocca into a tall, domed chamber that is supported by a circle of huge, rose-veined marble pillars. At its centre stands a large table and, from the ceiling directly above, a flood of light pours down, reflecting and refracting upon its crystal mosaic surface and bathing the chamber walls in spectral colours. She bids you take a seat at the table and, as she lowers herself elegantly into a seat opposite, you cannot but admire her beauty. Her face has the feline characteristics of a young lioness, yet her eyes and her youthful body are distinctly human, save for the soft, velvety nap which covers her flesh. She bears an aura that is powerful and confident, and yet at the same time she seems vulnerable and sad.‘How do you know my name?' you ask, slightly unnerved by the familiar way in which she welcomed you to her chamber.‘There is much I know about you,' she replies, veraciously, and at once you sense that you are in the presence of a god-like being. ‘Your land, and your fight against the forces of darkness who threaten to conquer it, are but a part of the struggle which rages throughout the Planes of Existence. Yet it is your world and your fight that has become the focus of this conflict between the powers of Good and Evil.' She pauses, and then staring deeply into your eyes, she continues: ‘Upon you depends the future of us all.'Stunned by the enormity of what she has said, you shake your head in open-mouthed silence: ‘No! How can this be?' you breathe incredulously.‘There are those who seek to shape destiny and those upon whom destiny falls. Destiny has chosen you, Lone Wolf, and you cannot refuse it, for it will force itself upon you.'‘But how have I become the focus of such a struggle?' you reply.‘We are all a part of it,' she says. ‘The worlds of Aon and the Daziarn are shaped by the actions of those who exist there. Yet the time has now come when the actions of one individual will shape the future of both worlds. You are that individual, Lone Wolf, and your actions are destined to shape the future of every living thing.'‘But what if I refuse?' you say, nervously. ‘What then will happen to the future?'‘You cannot refuse,' she says, softly. ‘For everything you do is bound up with your destiny. Your vow to complete the Magnakai quest and restore the Kai, will you give that up? Will you forsake your country and its future security? Will you abandon Magnamund to the evil of the Darklords? No, by your very nature—because of your honour and your courage—you will act out your part.'‘What then must I do?' you ask.‘You must do what you have always done. You must listen to the words of those who will help you and you must let your skills and instincts be your guide.' She leans forward and sweeps her hands slowly across the surface of the table. The light dims and patterns take shape among the tiny squares of crystal. ‘Observe and learn,' she says. ‘For the images will impart knowledge that will aid your quest for the Lorestones of your ancestors.'
1
250,
59,You feel the familiar chill of premonition as your Kai senses alert you to a tiny pair of eyes blinking in the gloom of the leafy canopy overhead. You sense that a hostile creature lurks there, waiting to fire at anything that comes within range of its lethal blowpipe.

339,If you have a Bow and wish to use it,

60,As you sprint along the path, the buzz of the creature's silver wings grows louder and louder.

61,Your light washes over the rough red walls and illuminates a narrow corridor, formed by a violent rending of the land. Warily you descend, taking care to avoid the deep pot-holes which riddle the uneven floor, and at length you emerge into a cramped airless cavern. At that moment a cacophony of noise surges along the fissure and the floor shudders and heaves beneath your feet. Then a great blast of dust and debris knocks you off balance as it is sucked out of the cavern by the whirlwind now raging directly above. The turmoil soon subsides, but, as you drag yourself to your feet, you notice that you are not alone.
1
161,
62,The Zhengha screeches low over your head, causing a massive down draught to flatten you to the ground. Instantly you are smothered by a blinding cloud of grit that reduces your vision to a blur, but, as the dust settles, you are able to make out the ominous shape of the Zhengha once more. It has landed nearby and is getting ready to exhale its fiery breath.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

310,If your total is now 0-5, 
49,If it is 6 or more, 
63,Under cover of the thick undergrowth you edge your way down towards the road, to a position opposite the three warriors. They are talking in whispers but your sharp hearing picks up every word of a language you find easy to understand. They are Meledorian scouts, who have been sent here to meet you <i xml:lang="">en route</i>. They are speculating on what has become of you and your chariot escort, now long overdue. You are about to break cover and introduce yourself when you notice something about them that swiftly changes your mind.
1
229,
64,Using your Kai skill you focus your telescopic vision on the far horizon and see a group of shapes that resemble small pyramids of stone. However, you are too far away to be able to tell if the structures are inhabited.A nearby stream meanders in the direction of the distant shapes and you decide to follow its course in the hope that it will lead you to them.
1
248,
65,A sharp pain in your forehead is followed immediately by a swirling rush of nausea. You swoon and crash heavily behind the trunk of the fallen tree as dizziness robs you of your balance. You have been struck in the head by a blowpipe dart which is coated with a deadly, fast-acting venom.
2
255,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, 
324,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
66,Carefully you prise open the heavy silver lid and stare at the shrunken remains of Lord Baylon. He lies on a mattress of diamonds and gemstones, his yellowed bones encased in ornate burial armour, and by his side rests a massive, two-handed sword. Its blade of solid gold is inscribed with a long list of battle honours and deeds of valour. You sense that this weapon is purely symbolic, a replica of his true sword, for its soft, gold blade would never hold a keen edge or withstand the rigours of battle. You are about to close the lid when you notice something else lying next to the sword: a Silver Flask. You pull its stopper and discover that it contains a wine that smells fresh and wholesome.
2
261,If you wish to drink some of the wine, 
323,If you decide to replace the flask and close the sarcophagus, 
67,Your Kai senses warn that you are in mortal danger. These beings suspect that you are a grave-robber come to loot the tomb of one of their ancestors. Unless you can persuade them otherwise they will not hesitate to kill you.

347,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and wish to attempt to communicate telepathically with the leader, 
184,If you choose to draw a weapon and prepare to defend yourself,

68,You are in combat with two Agtah scouts, who are determined to fight you to the death.These creatures are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, reduce your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 points for the first two rounds of combat, owing to the speed and surprise of their attack.
1
101,If you win the combat, 
69,Your senses scream a warning that the trees harbour hidden enemies. They are lurking, ready to ambush anyone who attempts to cross the bridge. You tell T'uk T'ron and immediately he orders his guards to dismount and take cover behind their chariots while he and his driver go forward to examine the damaged bridge.
2
282,If you wish to go with T'uk T'ron, 
158,If you decide to stay with his guards defending the chariots, 
70,The stairs lead to a passageway, which gives access to a street via hinged stone portals in the ceiling. You climb through one of the portals to emerge on a gloomy street corner.Few walk the shadowy avenues of Haagadar: the atmosphere is so thick with the smell of salt and sulphur that those whom you do pass are unrecognizable behind the damp pads they press to their faces to ward off the cloying stench. The dimly lit street ends at a central square, where you witness two encouraging sights. Roped to a stone monolith at the centre of the square is a huge, black bird—the scarlet warrior's winged steed. Behind it, rising in flat-topped tiers is the Temple of the Sandai. Two armour-clad creatures stand guard at the entrance, their rusty helmets crudely adapted to hold their face pads in position. You sense that the Lorestone is here, within the temple, and you scan every inch of it in the hope of finding an unguarded entrance. There are no other doors, but a circular, chimney-like vent protrudes from the middle of the highest tier.
2
217,If you decide to climb to the top of the temple and attempt to enter through the vent, 
38,If you wish to cover your face and attempt to bluff your way past the guards, 
71,Aching with battle fatigue you step back from your dead foes and wipe their foul black blood from your eyes. You have won the first clash of arms but it is a hollow victory, for the whole area swarms with hundreds of their kind. Their feral eyes glint maliciously in the pale blue mist as slowly they advance once more. To stay here would be suicidal—there are so many that you would eventually be overwhelmed by their sheer weight of numbers. Reluctantly you are forced back to the Grand Sepulchre and the three tentacled horrors that command its entrance.

34,
72,In the blink of an eye you load and fire your Bow, sending an Arrow spinning towards the giant's muscular chest. The tip bores into his golden flesh but it strikes a rib and is deflected. Maddened by the sudden pain the giant bellows a rumbling war-cry and lurches forward, intent on rending you limb from limb.This being is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
56,If you win the combat, 
73,You rejoin the track and sprint into the forest, thankful that the canopy of branches prevents an attack from the air. You stop to catch your breath and check your equipment, and discover to your dismay that the creature's attack ripped open your Backpack. Several items have fallen out during your escape.Erase from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> half the Meals you possessed, together with those items that appear second and fourth on your list of Backpack Items.

138,To continue, 
74,You recognize the flower to be a Haina. Its red petals are especially effective in the treatment of battle-wounds. Should you lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during a future combat, you will be able to restore 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately afterwards. They can only be used after combat.

77,You take aim at a yellow-fanged horror with black gums and huge, owl-like eyes, and send your shaft spinning into its chest. It continues to advance several paces, seemingly unaffected by the Arrow buried deep in its heart, until finally death conquers its will and it drops, rigid and lifeless, like a huge slab of stone. A shout causes you to glance over your shoulder and you see T'uk T'ron and the driver racing across the bridge. Another shout, harsh and bestial, draws your attention to the creature that is now leaping towards your head.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, reduce your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 points for the first two rounds of combat, owing to the surprise of its attack.

201,If you win the combat, 
78,Your Kai sense tells you that the food is untainted. You cannot identify any of the meats, vegetables, or fruits but you sense that they are especially nutritious.
2
119,If you wish to eat some of the Yoacor food, 
231,If you prefer to eat a Meal from your Backpack, 
79,You use your improved psychic skill to repair your thought-shield by catching and controlling part of the hostile energy being directed against you. The shadow creatures sense your psychic mastery and a whisper passes between them. They split up and the hooves of their steeds churn the cloud to a roiling ferment as they move at a gallop to surround you.
2
270,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge, 
41,If you do not possess this skill, 
80,From a gold-capped leather tube Lorkon produces a map of the Nahgoth which details the location of his encampment, the burial grounds of Tolakos, and the last known position of the Chaos-master's horde. The scale is measured in leagues but you are able to calculate that Tolakos lies only ten miles from Lorkon's camp. A curvy red line has been drawn diagonally across the map to show where scouts last sighted the Chaos-master's troops, and this line passes dangerously close to the burial grounds.‘You must leave as soon as possible if you are to be sure of reaching Tolakos before it is claimed by the enemy,' says Lorkon, pointing to the bold red line. ‘This was drawn three hours ago. If the Chaos-master decides to advance, he is within eight hours' march of the burial grounds. This means that in only the next five hours can you be sure to find Tolakos unoccupied. I intend to march my army forward and hold Tolakos but I await reinforcements and I dare not move until they arrive. Therefore I will provide you with a scout who knows the area well. He will guide you to your destination—the rest is up to you.'Lorkon sends for the scout, a Meledorian called Odel. When he arrives he suggests that you visit the equipment tent before setting off through the forest.
2
267,If you wish to take this opportunity to select some new equipment before venturing to Tolakos, 
121,If you wish to start your journey without delay, 
81,A freezing blast of psychic force lances through your mind, filling your head with intolerable pain: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. You reel from this unexpected assault and fight to regain control over your shaking limbs.

270,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge and wish to retaliate against these shadow creatures, 
41,If you do not possess this skill or do not wish to use it, 
82,Odel sits beside you with his back to the trunk, while he sets the metal crossbow that is strapped to his forearm. As soon as he is ready he turns, rises, and fires into the canopy of trees, sending a bronze-tipped bolt deep into the scaly belly of an Agtah sniper—your would-be assassin. The creature utters a piercing shriek and tumbles to the ground with a dull, sickening thud.You compliment Odel on his bow-skill and follow him as he moves forward to search the Chaos-creature's body.
1
178,
83,Drawing upon your psychic ability you commit yourself to a state of deep trance in which you are able to separate your spirit from your living body and step beyond your physical form. As if in a dream you move by the power of your will alone. Your astral body is naked and, although it seems no different in shape, it feels eerily light, translucent and impalpable. With total fascination you stare at your mortal form, seeing yourself for the first time as others see you.Your surroundings are the same but all sense of limitation is gone. You approach the door and thrust your hand against it but you encounter no obstruction. Your hand passes effortlessly through the platinum and into the corridor beyond. Intoxicated by your newfound power you venture further and explore the watchtower, its corridors, stairs, and chambers, but discover little that can aid your physical escape. There is only one exit from the tower and it is watched by more than a dozen heavily armed Yoacor guards. You are about to pass through them and continue out into the city itself when you feel your strength weakening: the time has come to rejoin your physical body. Quickly you return to the tower room, while you have power enough to spirit walk, and re-enter your mortal self.Your two bodies reunited, you are able to wake from your trance. You feel strangely cold and tired (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points) but you remember vividly every detail of your psychic experience.
2
170,If you wish to investigate the adjoining room, 
219,If you choose to remain in this room, 
84,A sudden sound makes you spin on your heel and instinctively you crouch down ready for combat. A small group of people, dressed in costumes that look vaguely familiar, are marching along the corridor towards the balcony. To avoid them, you hurry down a narrow stair that leads to the hall below and take cover behind the overladen table. From your hiding place you observe the group make their entrance. There are six of them: four men, one woman, and one other who walks with a stoop at the centre of the group and whom you cannot see clearly. You concentrate on their clothing, for there is something about its cut and style that is definitely familiar, yet you cannot pinpoint what it is. Then suddenly you recognize it, and the shock makes you draw breath: they are wearing Sommlending costumes. The five visible faces are now all too familiar to you: Luvias Kort, the Poisoner of Tyso; Falco, highwayman and cut-throat; Aieta Nematah, the Wytch of the Kirlundin Isles; Porgron, murderer; and Gardor Vezh, Chief Druid of Malis Mound, necromancer and cannibal. These are five of Sommerlund's most notorious criminals, all of whom were sentenced to be thrown into the Shadow Gate of Toran for their crimes.Five pairs of startled eyes glare at the table, alerted by your gasp, and the slick sound of blades leaving oiled scabbards soon follows. The four men and the woman, Aieta, raise their swords and step forward to challenge you. As they move apart you see the sixth member of their group clearly and an icy chill runs down your spine. Slowly you shake your head in disbelief as your stare is returned by the cold, malicious eyes of Vonotar the Traitor.‘Long have I waited for the chance to enact my revenge on you, Lone Wolf,' he hisses, his loathsome voice filling the hall with sibilant echoes, ‘and now my time has come. Kill him!' he screams, maniacally, and the five spring forward, eager to obey his command.You cannot evade this combat and must fight all five enemies to the death.
1
120,If you win the combat, 
85,Using your Kai skill you urge the onipa to stop. They react to your command immediately, stiffening their forelegs and skidding to an abrupt halt within a few inches of the river's edge. Shaken but otherwise unharmed, T'uk T'ron and his driver open their eyes and stare down at the murky water, scarcely able to believe that they are still dry and in one piece.
1
348,
86,In a frenzy of excitement the citizens of Thas press forward on all sides, pawing, prodding, and staring slack-jawed, as you are brought along the main street, which leads directly to the grey tower. Your escort are hard-pressed to keep the crowd at bay and, by the time you reach the tower door, your clothes are dishevelled and you are scratched and bruised: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.With a loud, grating rumble the stone door moves inwards and you are given into the charge of three bronze-clad Ookor wardens. They usher you up a winding stair to a bare chamber, floored and walled with smooth stone slabs. Silently a section of the drab wall moves aside and silhouetted in the opening stands the tall, feline shape of a remarkable creature. ‘I am Serocca,' she purrs, hypnotically, ‘and I bid you welcome, Lone Wolf. Come, enter my chamber, so that we may discuss your reasons for journeying so far to seek my help.'
2
311,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen and have reached the rank of Tutelary or higher, 
58,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
87,The scout removes the Obsidian Seal from your tunic pocket and studies it thoughtfully. ‘Very well,' he says, satisfied that you are the one they have been detailed to escort, ‘we will take you to Lorkon Ironheart.' He pockets the Obsidian Seal (delete this Special Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and motions you to approach his strange, long-haired steed.You ride pillion behind the saddle, yet the creature's shaggy coat makes for a comfortable seat as the steed gallops like a racehorse along the winding hill road. Huge tree trunks flash past—a blur of grey and brown—and the hills gradually recede until the forest rules supreme. The scouts leave the road and follow a smaller track which delves deep into this majestic timberland. They slow their pace, feeling safer now that they are back in familiar territory, and soon you arrive at a clearing. Hundreds of Meledorian soldiers are encamped here inside a perimeter wall of earth and logs. A cordon of sentries patrols the wall: they are alert and nervous, their eyes scrutinizing every shadow. A wheeled barricade of sawn timbers protects the only entrance and, at your approach, it is pushed aside to allow you entry. A small log cabin has been built at the heart of the tented encampment and the scouts bring their steeds to a halt near its front door. Quickly they dismount and usher you inside to meet their leader.
1
207,
88,Warily you draw the symbol in the soft surface of the square and step away from the door but, as soon as your finger leaves the square, a blast of cold vapour shoots from a tiny vent and catches you squarely in the face. You choke and retch as the bitter, poisonous gas seeps into your lungs.
2
223,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the rank of Mentora or higher, 
99,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
89,The wind tears at your clothing as you fight your way slowly towards the distant gully. Your feet sink deep into the hot, shifting sands, transforming the simple act of walking into a hard and painful exertion. After what seems like an eternity you finally near your goal. You drop to your knees and crawl the few remaining yards towards the shelter of the shallow, rock-strewn trench. Gasping for breath, you bury your head inside your tunic to avoid inhaling a lungful of the sand-choked air and, gradually, your pulse steadies and your strength returns. You wait for the storm to subside but, as if in defiance of your wish, the winds grow ever stronger, whipping the sands into huge cyclones which suck countless tons of debris into their deadly, spinning cores.Fear returns to freeze your heart when the shadow of a raging whirlwind falls across the gully. In blind desperation you crawl towards a narrow fissure at the far end of the trench, praying that it is the entrance to a cave. This time your prayers are answered—the fissure marks the beginning of a shaft that descends deep into the volcanic rock. But as you draw closer your hopes for a safe shelter are dampened by a gruesome sight.
1
126,
90,The golden glow fades as the wisdom contained within the Lorestone is infused into your being. Your spirit soars, but you do not allow your euphoria to blind you to the danger that is closing on Tolakos. You turn and run back towards the entrance to the Grand Sepulchre, intending to seek sanctuary behind its door, but your foot catches on something sharp and sends you sprawling to the ground. The toe of your left boot is cut through but fortunately your foot has escaped without a scratch. Cautiously you try to locate what caused such a vicious cut and discover the scarlet warrior's curvy-bladed sword.
2
8,If you wish to keep this weapon, 
346,If you do not, 
91,You scan the surrounding trees, your eyes peeled for the slightest hint of another enemy, while Odel examines the dead Agtah. He shakes his head, indicating that he has found nothing of interest, and beckons you onward. Just as you begin to move you catch sight of a grey shape scurrying away into the misty distance. Quickly you draw an Arrow and take aim, but the creature is no longer there—it has melted into the shadows.
1
185,
92,Your senses warn you that a hostile creature is lurking immediately behind and below you. At the first opportunity it intends to grab your legs and drag you into the river. Forewarned, you prepare to deliver this creature a fatal surprise.
2
296,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
155,If you do not, 
93,Cradled in the muscular arms of a Yoacor guard lies the loathsome, stunted form of the Beholder. His withered, corpse-green body is no bigger than a human child's, yet his bulbous head is enormous by comparison, far larger even than that of the giant who is holding him. It wobbles and sways repulsively when he turns to focus his eyes on you. Like polished gemstones these two blank orbs glint in the flickering light of the chamber, their cold sharpness revealing the intelligent being that lies imprisoned within the crippled shell.‘Be not afraid of me, human,' he says, using a language similar to your native tongue. ‘I mean you no harm. My shape may not find favour with those of your species, but here in the Daziarn you must be prepared to disregard appearances if you are to discern the truth.'With a languid blink he dismisses the Yoacor leader and his guards and watches like a doting father as they descend the spiral staircase.
2
291,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination, 
152,If you do not possess this skill, 
94,The chariots screech to a halt and a score of Ookor guards leap from the riding platforms. They come scurrying towards you, their glass-tipped spears thrust before them at arm's length. Their leader commands them to surround you. His order is swiftly obeyed and you are escorted back to the gates of their city at spearpoint.

95,Your Arrow misses its head completely and the beast swoops down to flatten you with its massive down draught. Instantly you are smothered by a blinding cloud of grit that reduces your vision to a blur. But, as the dust settles, you are able to make out the ominous shape of the Zhengha once more. It has landed nearby and is now poised to exhale its fiery breath.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

96,While you ponder the meaning of her reading, she retrieves her cards from the table and shuffles away to help her daughters gather the empty food bowls. T'uk T'ron swallows the last of his delicious meal and rounds it off with a hearty belch. The Ookor villagers thank him—for it seems that such a reaction is the highest compliment one can pay after receiving Ookor hospitality.‘We can go now, yes?' he says, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. You nod your reply and he in turn barks an order to his company to return to their chariots.As your chariot pulls away from her village the old fortune teller waves farewell and you return her gesture with a smile.

97,He draws a curvy-bladed sword and prepares to greet you with its razor-sharp edge. You strike first but he parries and returns your blow with great skill. For his size he is as quick as a cat and, despite his wound, you sense that he will be a difficult opponent to defeat.

306,If you reduce his <small>ENDURANCE</small> to 20 points or less, do not continue the combat but 
123,If you kill him before his <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 20 points (that is if you score an ‘automatically killed' result on the Combat Results Table), 
98,Your silent surrender seems to anger the leader. It is as if you were in some way insulting his honour by refusing to answer him or take up a weapon in defence of your life. He bellows his contempt and, in a fit of rage, releases from his silver rod a charge of raw power that lances through your chest. Death is instantaneous.

99,Rapidly you succumb to the deadly toxins suspended in the vapour, and sink into a coma induced by the poison now circulating in your blood. Your senses grow numb and consciousness fades as you begin your journey into the timeless oblivion of death.
0
100,Suddenly the visions are obscured by a dazzling light which shines so brilliantly that you are forced to shield your eyes against the glare. Many moments pass before you can make out the shape of what looms above: it is the huge face of a mighty warrior, strong and wise, whose golden eyes stare down at you with supernatural majesty. A kindly smile softens his heroic features and a voice, deep and wondrous, rumbles from his throat.<em>‘In this age of darkness you have been chosen to fulfil the quest of the Magnakai. Be true to the quest, for the greatness born within you can save your people and right the imbalance which threatens to destroy your world. Doubt not your purpose nor your strength, for inside you there burns a flame that can light the hopes of future men for all time.'</em>The divine radiance of his being and the gravity of his words fill you with wonderment, for your senses tell you that you are now in the presence of your creator—the immortal God Kai.

51,
101,You leap over the bodies of the dead Agtah and press on with your search. Ahead you see a glimmer of gold in the pale blue luminescence and you thrust your hand towards it into the mist. A tingling sensation runs the length of your arm, filling your body with an incredible sense of strength and well-being as you close your hand around the Lorestone and hold it up before your eyes.

90,Restore your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score to its original level and 
102,You are powerless to prevent the Beholder's psychic intrusion, but at least the ordeal is mercifully short: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. He scans your mind thoroughly. Then, with a blink of his eyes, he ceases his psychic probing and a smile spreads slowly across his withered grey face.

103,You are in combat with a pack of slimy chaos-beasts intent on eating you alive!These creatures are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
2
298,You may evade combat after three rounds by running back to the Grand Sepulchre and attempting to force your way in: 
71,If you win the combat, 
104,The bolt penetrates your chest and knocks you backwards into the undergrowth. The canopy of branches spins before your eyes and, as you gasp for breath, you taste blood and feel a terrifying numbness spread through your body. There is no pain as you slip gently into the oblivion of death.
0
105,You release the taut bowstring and send your Arrow streaking towards the amber eye, but it misses its intended target by a hand's breadth and ricochets harmlessly off the creature's stone-hard scales. The creature emits a loud, gurgling croak as it edges forward, forcing you to drop your Bow and draw a hand weapon in readiness to receive its attack.
1
245,If you win the combat, 
106,You find it impossible to resist the strange compulsion drawing you towards the light. Effortlessly you glide along the tunnel and emerge at the centre of a huge, transparent sphere suspended in a luminous yellow sea of oily liquid. Behind its seamless walls swim fish-like creatures, strange things with phosphorescent bodies and opalescent jaws. You stare in fascination as they swim around you, seemingly oblivious of your presence.
1
209,
107,Gently the Sommerswerd vibrates in its scabbard and a cool, golden fire laps at the hilt. Instinctively you unsheathe it and immediately the blade is engulfed by golden flames, ignited by the close proximity of the Lorestones. As you raise the sword, the flames burn brighter and illuminate the circular portal in the ceiling. At once you realize that it must provide access to the roof of the Sepulchre and, with your heart pounding, you race up the steps, confident of finding the objects of your quest waiting for you there.
1
320,
108,You watch as suspicion turns to fear in these creatures' eyes. They become agitated, jabbing the air with their glass-tipped spears and cawing incessantly in their strange tongue. They sway, like half-coiled serpents weaving before a snake charmer, and then, as one, they rush forward and attack.Owing to the speed and ferocity of their charge, you cannot evade them or make use of a Bow.

203,If you win the combat, 
109,Drawing on your Kai Mastery you attempt to repel this fearsome reptilian. You sense that it is weak and starving and close to death—a condition which makes it especially susceptible to your commands.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 1 point for every Magnakai Discipline you possess over and above the first three skills (for example, if you possess five Magnakai Disciplines, add 2 points to the number you have picked).

130,If your total is now 0-6, 
295,If it is 7 or more, 
110,The onipa slide stiff-legged down the slippery bank and the chariot slews violently to the left before coming to a halt within a few inches of the river's edge. Shaken but otherwise unharmed, T'uk T'ron and his driver open their eyes and stare down at the murky water, scarcely able to believe that they are still dry and in one piece.

348,
111,The Chaos-master catches a glimpse of you crouching behind the parapet and diverts his aim from Lorkon Ironheart. With malicious glee he slams his great club down upon the roof and, in a terrifying moment, you are crushed to death.
0
112,Slowly you awaken and for a long moment you lie on the hard floor blinking sleepily at the pitted rock ceiling. The storm died down while you slept and all is quiet save for a sound that sets your pulse racing: the distant slap of large wings beating the air. The sound is becoming louder and you gather your equipment quickly and climb out of the cairn to investigate its source.Silhouetted against the blazing horizon are six black shapes. They resemble dragons with snaky necks and ragged, bat-like wings, and upon their backs they carry golden-skinned creatures, vaguely human in appearance save for their lack of hair and their massive size. From their flight formation you can tell that they are hunting something on the ground, but it is not until you climb to the top of the cairn that you are able to see their prey. A brace of huge, lizard-like creatures are thundering across the plateau, darting this way and that to avoid the shadows cast by their winged pursuers. They reach the top of a rock-strewn ridge and one of the crimson reptilians comes pounding across the sand towards the cairn. The leading flyer sees you. He banks his dragon mount towards the cairn and the others follow closely in his wake. You fear that they are about to attack but at the last moment they veer away and circle the cairn before landing nearby.

26,
113,In spite of his attempts to deflect your Arrow, it penetrates the cheek plate less than an inch below his eye. He bellows an agonized cry and wrenches the shaft from his face. Such fortitude is impressive but you can tell that he has suffered a serious wound. Feverishly he scoops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt. Swiftly you shoulder your Bow and draw a hand weapon as you run forward to prevent his escape.

206,
114,Shocked by your encounter with the Agtah you make your way deeper into the hills, skirting the road in favour of the wooded slopes, which offer good cover. Yet you keep the road in sight constantly to ensure that you are heading towards Tolakos. Your usual good sense of direction is vague and distorted, for in this region of the Daziarn there are no sun, stars, or points of the compass by which to gauge your position.The hours pass uneventfully until you reach a place where the road runs alongside a pool of crystal-clear water, fed by a fast-flowing stream. Three human-shaped warriors clad in armour are standing near the pool, scanning the woods, while their shaggy black equine mounts drink their fill.
2
150,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Divination or Pathsmanship, 
63,If you possess neither of these skills, 
115,You reach the crest of the hill and stare down at the remarkable sight that lies beyond. A walled city of low, pyramid-shaped dwellings is spread along the centre of a narrow valley. Near the middle, rising high above the other buildings, stands a tower of stone, its colour identical to the drab grey of the sky. Its straight thoroughfares are thronged with hairy, ape-like creatures who pass freely and leisurely through the narrow streets.The path leads down to an open gate in the city wall where two of its squat-limbed inhabitants stand guard. You are relieved to have at last discovered a vestige of civilization in this strange land, and you set off for the city gate at a brisk pace.

215,
116,Your senses warn that a powerful spell protects this portal. If you inscribe the wrong symbol on the blank square you will break the spell, the consequences of which could be fatal!

25,
117,A few miles beyond the village, the road leaves the valley and crosses an open expanse of lush grassland. The hours roll by and you watch the passing landscape with increasing wonder as you try to comprehend how it can thrive beneath a sunless sky. Slowly the plain descends towards a wide river, sluggish with sediment and flanked by tall, grey-green trees. A bridge spans the dark water and the road continues beyond towards a line of hills. The bridge is built of stout timber, but as you draw closer to it you sense that something is seriously amiss.

48,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery and have reached the rank of Principalin or higher, 
321,If you do not have this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
118,Your detour takes you through a marshy section of the Nahgoth where firm ground gives way to thorn-guarded shrubs and ankle-deep slime. You press on and, as you disturb the surface of the mire, you release a cloud of vile, choking marsh gas.Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing (at the rank of Mentora or higher), or the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus (at the rank of Primate or higher), lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points owing to the insidious effect of the gas.

120,As the last of your enemies falls dead at your feet, the traitor vents a shrill cry of terror and scurries like a bloated spider towards the Shadow Gate. In his hand he clutches a banded, leaden box and, as he runs, he works feverishly at the lock. Suddenly the lid springs back and your senses burn as the power of the last Lorestone is uncovered. Now instinct alone guides your actions. You sprint towards him, determined to stop him from entering the Shadow Gate. He squeals with fear and turns to face you, his hand raised, a ring of blue fire pulsating on his finger. He screams a curse and a jet of cold fire lances your chest and slams you to the floor: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. As you stagger to your feet, the traitor runs forward to finish you with another blast. You dive aside and the blast tears open the floor but, before he can launch another, you leap forward and attack.He is immune to Mindblast and Psi-surge.

350,If you win the combat, 
121,Lorkon escorts you to the door of his cabin and wishes you luck. You thank him and bid him farewell. As you turn to leave, he calls out, ‘Remember, I will be marching to Tolakos as soon as my reinforcements arrive.'You follow Odel, leaving the encampment by slipping over the perimeter wall. Soon you merge like shadows into the thick forest beyond. The giant trunks support a canopy of dense foliage that blocks out the light and keeps the forest floor bathed in a perpetual twilight. A carpet of moss muffles your footfalls and the only foliage that grows in abundance is a bushy velvet lichen patterned with orange-headed, tooth-sized growths. ‘Khetu Spores,' says Odel, noticing your interest in the strange flora. ‘They're deadly poisonous.'If you wish to collect a handful of the poisonous Khetu Spores, mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.

122,The Beholder deactivates the light-picture and wills his servant to carry him back to the first gallery. There, bathed in the shadowless glow of the fireball, stands a huge globe of silvery metal. At his approach it radiates an eerie phosphorescent light and symbols appear upon its surface.‘The Lorestones entered the Shadow Gate some moments before you fell, is that not so?' asks the Beholder, incisively. You confirm this to be the case and watch with fascination as the symbols shift and change colour. ‘There are many channels within the Shadow Gate that are warped by the vagaries of time and space. Usually it is an impossible task to predict where an object passing through to the Daziarn will materialize, but the coordinates of your arrival are known and this will help my calculations.'Slowly the symbols begin to disappear until just three remain. ‘Without knowing the precise Aon-time they entered the Shadow Gate I can find only an approximate location,' he says, scrutinizing the symbols. ‘As reckoned by the time-scale of your planet, the Lorestones arrived on the Daziarn forty-one hours ago. They materialized together and intact in the forest of the Khat Trisect of Vhozada—a realm situated between the elemental strongholds of Earth and Water. This bodes well for you, human. Vhozada is a temperate and stable domain, rich in those elements necessary to sustain mortal life-forms. Also, there is one of great vision who has made this her home. Her name is Serocca. It would be wise to seek her help in finding these stones of power, for she is sure to know their whereabouts.'Although his words revive your flagging hopes, you are still fearful that the Lorestones are beyond your recovery. The Beholder senses your apprehension and tries to allay your fears by offering you a means of transportation to the realm of Vhozada. He promises that your passage will be swift, but, when you learn what the journey entails, your blood runs cold.

123,The warrior shrieks his death-cry and falls backwards, his arms outstretched and his fingers clawing blindly at the air. By chance they become tangled in the rope ladder and his body is lifted into the air as the giant black bird takes to the sky. A wave of panic engulfs you. In desperation you leap up and aim a blow at the small sack in an attempt to cut it loose. Your blow slices open the velvet and one of the two Lorestones tumbles into the graveyard below, coming to rest close to the door of the Sepulchre. Angry and crestfallen, you watch as the bird and its precious cargo rise above the trees and listen helplessly as the muffled flap of its wings fades into the distance.

237,
124,T'uk T'ron slaps the driver's shoulder. Immediately he hauls on the reins and pulls at a lever which activates the wheel brakes, bringing the chariot to a squealing halt. The others stop nearby and the guards clamber down from the riding platforms unsteadily, their legs weak and trembling after hours of riding along the bumpy track. They are familiar with this village and without hesitation they head towards a thatched hut that is set back from the road.You accompany the captain and his driver into the hut, stooping to enter the Ookor-sized doorway. The villagers seem delighted to receive you as their guest and ply you eagerly with food and wine. One of them, an elderly female with kindly eyes, hobbles to your side and places a deck of cards on the table. ‘She is teller of fortunes,' says T'uk T'ron. ‘You want she tell your fortune, yes?'
2
24,If you wish to have your fortune told, 
18,If you wish to refuse her offer politely, 
125,As soon as you complete the square it begins to fade. Then a blast of icy cold vapour shoots from a vent beside the door and catches you squarely in the face. You choke and retch as the bitter, poisonous gas seeps into your lungs.

223,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the rank of Mentora or higher, 
99,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
126,Strewn around the entrance to the fissure are the bleached and shattered bones of what was once a formidable creature. Nervously you reach for a weapon as you approach the narrow gap and peer into its lightless depths. A strange smell, sweet and unwholesome, wafts out of the inky blackness and stops you dead in your tracks. But the deafening roar of the approaching tornado makes you swallow your fear and enter. Cautiously you descend into the dark, your weapon held poised to counter a sudden attack.

61,If you have a Kalte Firesphere, a Lantern, or a Torch and Tinderbox, and wish to use any of them, 
313,If you do not possess any of these items, or do not wish to use them, but still wish to advance deeper into the fissure to avoid the raging tornado, 
236,If you choose not to advance but to stay where you are, 
127,Your Arrow opens a shallow wound in the creature's belly, but it does not deter it from attacking you with its sword-sharp fangs.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
162,If you win the combat, 
128,You manage to unsheathe your weapon and strike a blow that carves a crimson wedge from the ugly creature's snout. It gives an angry, gurgling cry and recoils in pain, freeing you from its grip and allowing you time to climb through the hole. However, although the beast is wounded, it is not defeated. Driven by pain and a blind lust for revenge, it tears its way through the planking and hurls itself at you recklessly.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
289,If you win the combat, 
129,Your Kai skill enables you to identify these plants: they are Senara, exceedingly rare on Magnamund but seemingly abundant here in Vhozada. The unripened buds of this herb have great restorative qualities and when eaten will enable you to regain lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Each Meal of Senara will restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and there are enough buds in this field for over 100 Meals.If you wish to keep any of the Senara buds, remember to make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

115,To continue, 
130,Your commands slow the animal's advance but they do not persuade it to pass up the opportunity of a good meal. It growls, weakly but hungrily, and prepares itself for an attack.

227,
131,The portal is secured by a massive metallic lock, and engraved into its blackened surface is a quartered square. In three of the four quarters there are etched symbols, but the fourth quarter, which is formed of a soft, clay-like substance, remains blank. Your basic Kai instincts tell you that the symbols are a clue to a Meledorian code that unlocks the great door. By inscribing the correct symbols in the soft surface of the blank square, you will cause the portal to open. Study the sequence carefully:
2
116,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship or Divination, 
25,If you possess neither of these skills, 
132,The beings scowl with disdain when you offer no reply. Their leader draws a silver rod from inside his Khozinda-scale vest, levels it menacingly at your chest, and slowly repeats the words he has spoken.

347,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and wish to attempt to communicate telepathically with the leader, 
184,If you choose to draw a weapon and prepare to defend yourself, 
98,If you decide to raise your hands in surrender, 
133,As the last of your foul enemies falls dead at your feet, you sheathe your weapon and drag their blood-spattered corpses away from the great door. Then you push closed the heavy portal, making sure that it is secure, before climbing the stair to the roof.

27,
134,Owing to the awkward position of the beam, it is impossible to apply any leverage to force it back into its proper place. The only way you will get it to move is by using a Rope.
2
198,If you have a Rope and wish to use it, 
43,If you do not possess a Rope or do not wish to use it, 
135,Quickly you try to retrace your route to the stream, but you soon come to an abrupt halt: a group of hairy, squat-limbed creatures is moving through the undergrowth towards you. They are armed with crude spears which they carry at the ready, like hunters stalking their prey.
3
256,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
75,If you wish to take cover in the undergrowth and wait for them to pass, 
301,If you wish to avoid them by returning to the monolith, 
136,The warrior answers your demand with a mocking laugh, his green, cat-like eyes glinting through the slits of his visor. Hurriedly he snatches the Lorestones with his gloved hands and drops them into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt. Angered by his audacity and fearful of losing the Lorestones, you unsheathe a weapon and run forward, determined to prevent his escape.

22,
137,A wave of panic washes across T'uk T'ron's face and he screams frantically at his driver to stop. He pulls on the reins and steers the onipa away from the bridge, but he leaves it too late to apply the wheel brake. With a terrified shriek he and the driver cover their eyes as the muddy water looms into view.

85,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control,

138,At length you emerge from the twisted trees of the chaos-zone and follow the track as it wends its way through the Nahgoth Forest beyond. Your journey passes slowly and without incident until, after countless hours of travel, you arrive at the edge of the Plain of Guakor. You are now very tired and must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Rather than attempting to cross the barren plain immediately, you decide to rest here and continue after some much needed sleep. Ten hours later you wake refreshed and eager to begin the next leg of your journey to Haagadar. After checking your equipment and your map, you set off across the featureless plateau.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

318,If the number you have picked is 0-2, 
202,If it is 3-9, 
139,You return to the first room and peer out of a tall window that looks out over the city. Far below you can see the Yoacor crowding an avenue which leads to an outer level of Yanis. They move with such purposefulness that, from this great height, they resemble a vast community of worker ants. For several hours you stare down at this beautiful alien city and its industrious citizens while you try to make sense of your situation. Eventually you resolve to find out all you can from the one the leader called the ‘Beholder'. Perhaps he will be able to help you locate the Lorestones and find a way back to Magnamund. At length you settle down to sleep.
1
317,
140,The rusty bars offer little resistance to a couple of well placed kicks and you are able to gain entry to the circular chute with ease. A narrow walkway runs beside the gurgling channel, ascending by steps and ramps as the climb becomes increasingly steep. The dark stone walls are beaded with moisture and smeared with patches of luminous fungi which keep the sewer bathed in an eerie green half-light. At length you reach a landing where a smaller channel joins the main flow. As you pass it and set foot on the stairs beyond, you hear a sound, like the rustling of leather on stone, and sense that something hungry is advancing along the tunnel towards you.
2
3,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
168,If you do not possess this skill, 
141,As the sound of your voice begins to fade, a whirling streak of shining silver emerges out of the darkness. The sudden rush of wind knocks you backwards and you see, soaring on wide gossamer wings, a huge, worm-like monstrosity take to the air. It circles the clearing, and then swoops down to attack you with its sword-sharp fangs.

284,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
257,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and prepare to defend yourself, 
60,If you choose to evade its attack by running along the path into the forest, 
142,The strange, anthropoid creatures pass within a few feet of the bushes where you are hiding, but they fail to detect you. Only when you are sure that the coast is clear do you leave your hiding place and hurry away from the monolith and its protectors.

153,
143,Nonchalantly you brush the red flower away and fix your eyes on the road ahead. You have not eaten today and must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery you are unable, on this occasion, to use this skill in lieu of eating a Meal from your Backpack.

117,
144,Lorkon and his Meledorian troops are overjoyed to have witnessed the spectacular defeat of the Chaos-master, for your victory has rid them of their greatest enemy. They call to you to come down from the roof and, when you appear at the doorway, they shower you with praise.‘We owe you more than our lives, Aonian,' says Lorkon, his strange blue eyes aglow with admiration. ‘Your great deed has saved our realm and put an end to the plague of chaos that would have corrupted us all. We are forever in your debt.'As he shakes your hand he notices the blade with which you dispatched the Chaos-master. ‘It is a good omen for my clan that the sword you used to banish the evil one was forged by my ancestors. I am doubly proud that it served you well. But now it must return to the Grand Sepulchre, for such is our law.'It is with some reluctance that you return the Ironheart Broadsword to its rightful steward (delete this Special Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), for never before have you wielded as fine a sword as this.

173,
145,You scan the barren wasteland, straining your senses to detect the missing Lorestones, which must be somewhere among the millions of rocks and wind-smoothed boulders that cover the vast plateau. But it proves a fruitless search: you can find no trace of the Lorestones nor even the slightest indication that a Shadow Gate opened here.

297,
146,You dive behind the trunk but you feel a stinging sensation as the blowpipe dart scratches the side of your neck. A wave of nausea churns your stomach and your throat becomes painfully tight, restricting your breathing and causing your pulse to race: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.Odel appears at your side and wipes the scratch with a handful of fungi culled from the bark of Baylon's Bough.

147,Your shaft strikes wide, glancing off his shoulder and disappearing over the parapet of the roof. He utters a mocking laugh, his cat-like eyes glinting through the slits in his visor, and hurriedly drops the Lorestones into a small sack tied to his sword belt. Angered by his laugh, and by your failure, you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon and rush forward, determined to prevent his escape.
1
22,
148,At length you abandon your observation: you are unable to see any sign of intelligent life in the surrounding landscape. You decide to follow a nearby stream in the hope that it will lead eventually to a river, where the chances of finding a village or settlement should be higher.

248,
149,With a haunting scream, the evil shadows fade and dissolve in the swirling clouds. A loud wind whistles in your ears, carrying the mournful sound of a tolling bell. At the centre of the cloud a ray of golden light pulses like a heartbeat in time to the chime of the bell. It draws you towards it and you cannot resist its call.

You are his prisoner, yet he speaks to you as if you were free to leave at any time.

164,
153,You are eager to put a good distance between yourself and the monolith, so you decide to run beside the stream for as long as your legs will allow. Time passes rapidly, although the terrain changes very little until you reach a line of low hills, spread out before you like a sleeping colossus. Here a path ascends from the bank of the stream to the crest of the hill and you follow it. On reaching the crest you stare down at a remarkable and daunting sight.

154,The chamber is filled with valuable tapestries and furnishings, but there is little that can be carried out with ease. Certain that you have overlooked nothing of practical value, you head for the roof in order to spy on the surrounding Chaos-creatures.
1
27,
155,With almost casual stealth you unsheathe a weapon and hold it poised to strike. The creature is close: you can sense it getting ready to attack. There is a rustle of fur. Swiftly you raise your legs to avoid the sweeping lunge of two hairy, clawed paws. Then you strike a blow that carves a crimson wedge from its ugly snout. The creature gives a gurgling scream and scrambles through the hole, driven by pain and its blind lust for revenge.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
289,If you win the combat, 
156,Having listened to your explanation the giants react with scepticism, but, despite their doubts, they are clearly fascinated by your appearance and the sound of your voice. ‘We are the Yoacor,' says the leader, proudly. ‘We are the Lords of Yanis—the Shining City—and masters of the Abaxial of Czenos. Come, we will take you to our realm where you may tell your strange story to the Beholder. He will divine its worth.'He beckons you to approach his dragonmount and you step forward. The thought of being left marooned in this wilderness is all you need to persuade you to obey his command.

205,
157,There are very few places on this desolate plain that offer cover from the air. You run towards the nearest—a group of boulders—and curl up among them in the hope that you will escape the Zhengha's wicked gaze.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility, add 1 to this number for every Magnakai Discipline you possess.
2
349,If your total is now 0-8, 
230,If it is 9 or more, 
158,You watch T'uk T'ron and the driver scurry across the planks, using the parapet of the bridge as cover. They reach the centre and are examining the damage when a chilling scream, like the baying of a crazed wolf pack, echoes from the trees. Grey shapes jostle in the shadows and your heart freezes in a moment of horror as they advance into the light.Lumbering hordes of twisted shapes stagger from the trees on both sides of the bridge. They appear to be neither human nor animal but a ghastly fusion of the two. Their heads are of differing types: some are like cats with huge, green eyes; some are like boars with snouts and twisting tusks; others have rams' heads, sabre-toothed and riddled with decay. The Ookor guards tremble with fear and whisper the word ‘Agtah' as these monstrosities draw closer.
3
77,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
226,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and prepare to defend yourself, 
335,If you choose to leave the chariot and join T'uk T'ron on the bridge, 
159,A wave of psychic energy rushes through your mind, washing across your thoughts, searching for some sign of hostile intent. You resist the intrusion and the wave quickly recedes.
1
314,
160,Slowly the clouds separate, and a tall tower of glistening white stone looms before you. A globe of golden light hangs suspended in mid-air above its conical roof, pulsating with heat and radiating power like a tiny, new-born sun.Its comforting warmth draws you towards an open portal at the side of the tower. Beyond it you see a dark tunnel that descends towards a speck of misty yellow light.
2
312,If you have completed the Lore-circle of the Spirit, 
106,If not, 
161,A low, croaking growl issues from the far side of the cavern and suddenly two slits appear, from which a baleful orange light radiates. With bated breath you watch a shape emerge from the shadows: a long, scaly form with short legs and a lizard-like head. The outline of its body, perfectly camouflaged against the red volcanic rock, pulses like a heartbeat as it awakens from its slumber. It swivels its horny head and fixes you with an alien gaze, its snake-like eyes glittering with malice.
2
13,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and have reached the rank of Primate or higher, 
271,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
162,Your killing blow almost severs the Tazgar's head and sends the vile creature spinning wildly into the trees amid a spray of its own foul blood. Without waiting to discover if it was the only one of its kind, you sheathe your weapon and hurry away from the clearing.
1
138,
163,The berry-like growths smell sweet and succulent. They awaken your appetite and remind you that your last meal was several hours ago.
2
234,If you wish to eat a handful of these orange berries, 
247,If you decide to ignore your hunger and press on, 
164,You walk beside the Beholder along a corridor which leads to a vast, circular gallery. At its centre stands a towering, bell-shaped vessel made out of transparent, glass-like material and filled with a huge, seething ball of fire. Its brilliant light illuminates some strange equipment standing against the walls and cluttering the tables, but little of its heat radiates into the room. You pass on until you come to another gallery which is floored with shining steel like a gigantic mirror. The domed roof is lost in the dim shadows, but at its centre you notice a tiny, disc-shaped portal. The Beholder glances at a row of crystals embedded in the wall and they glow in response to his psychic commands.‘I am called the Beholder,' he says, his thin voice echoing loudly in the emptiness of the dome. ‘I observe all that transpires in the Daziarn. I saw your arrival upon the Zhamin Plateau and I know from whence you came. So few of your kind survive transference that I abandoned all hope of meeting you. Indeed had you not met with one of my hunting parties your bones would now lie bleaching upon the sands of that arid plain. It seems that you are by nature a survivor.'Suddenly a swirling column of light appears, projected from the disc in the centre of the dome. It casts a pool of brilliance in the middle of the gallery and gradually widens until it encompasses the whole floor.‘Come, observe, and perhaps you will learn the nature of your new world. For you will need to adapt if you are to survive here…for the rest of your life.'
1
268,
165,You claw the mud from your eyes to see the onipa team veer away from the river just in time to save the chariot from a watery end. It comes to an abrupt stop within inches of the river's edge and, as you wade towards it, T'uk T'ron and his driver appear above the rim of the platform and stare at you, glassy-eyed with shock. The other chariots draw to a halt behind and T'uk T'ron's chariot is hauled out of the mud. As they are steering it back onto the road, you notice that the centre of the bridge is damaged. Some of the planks have been torn up and left strewn across the surface, crudely disguising the gaping hole. Quickly you rejoin T'uk T'ron in the chariot and inform him of what you have seen.
2
69,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the Kai rank of Tutelary, 
196,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
166,As you run across the tangled and broken ground towards Baylon's tomb you are assailed by two Agtah wielding large chunks of masonry. Swiftly you dispatch them with two well placed blows and reach the tomb unscathed. There you find that the lock which secures the door is similar in design to that of the Grand Sepulchre. As before, there are three groups of symbols and one blank square, although the symbols inscribed here are quite different from those that confronted you at the Grand Sepulchre. They look like this:By inscribing the correct symbols in the soft surface of the blank square you will cause the door to open.
2
197,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship or Divination, 
315,If you possess neither of these skills, 
167,Drawing on your mastery of Invisibility, you use your skills to evade the searching eyes of these strange anthropoid creatures. They pass within a few feet of you but fail to detect your presence. Only when you are sure that the coast is clear do you leave your hiding place and hurry away from the monolith and its protectors.
1
153,
168,A clacking of fangs and a cold, ophidian smell serve to warn you that a gigantic serpent is advancing towards the landing, attracted by the promising warmth and scent of your body. It is moving very quickly and you realize at once that your only hope of evading it is to delay its advance.
2
12,If you possess a minimum of 4 Meals, 
327,If you do not possess this amount of food, 
169,With your forefinger you draw the symbols in the doughy material and push against the mighty door, expecting it to rumble open. The portal remains firm and your inscription begins to fade until there is no trace of it at all. The rush of fearful premonition steals your breath away seconds before a massive charge of crackling power leaps from above the door and stabs you viciously in the chest: lose 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
1
25,If you survive this serious wounding, 
170,Warily you enter the room, noting that in spite of a lack of windows and torches it is bathed in a warm amber light. The opalescent glow pours from the walls themselves, illuminating a table set with colourful food and a huge, cushioned divan standing beside it. The oversize Yoacor furniture makes you feel like a small child exploring a dining chamber for adults, but your hunger soon quells your unease and entices you towards the table. You are very hungry after your long flight to Yanis and must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
3
78,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Curing, 
119,If you wish to eat some of the Yoacor food, 
231,If you choose to eat a Meal from your Backpack, or decide to go without food altogether (remember to deduct 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), 
171,Your Arrow misses its mark by an inch and dents the plate that protects the bridge of the warrior's nose. The metal buckles and cuts his face, momentarily stunning him, but it does not prevent him from scooping the Lorestones into a small velvet sack, which hangs from his sword belt. Quickly you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon and rush forward to prevent his escape.
1
97,
172,The cards you have chosen have three colourful symbols embossed on their leather-like surface. The first shows a black bird, the second a tree, and the third shows two swords crossed over a blazing fire. The old Ookor traces a crooked finger around the cards and mutters continually under her breath. T'uk T'ron leans forward and tries to translate her mumblings.‘She say that you have an enemy in the skies. He come to nest in trees and fight with you. He not win fight but you not win fight either. You must beware this enemy for he will not rest until you die.'
1
96,
173,Lorkon orders that word of the victory be sent immediately to his people, and commands that a celebration be held in your honour. But the urgency of your quest prompts you to forego the festivities and begin your journey to Haagadar at once. Lorkon understands your need to make haste and offers to help you by assigning another scout to guide you through the Nahgoth to the Plain of Guakor.
2
5,If you wish to accept Lorkon's offer of help, 
183,If you choose to continue your quest alone, 
174,The unexpected speed and intensity of the Beholder's psychic intrusion leaves you fumbling for defence. You draw on your psychic reserves and manage to erect a thought-wall to protect your nervous system, but it is too late to prevent the Beholder from scanning your mind: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.Then, with a blink of his eyes, he ceases his psychic probing and a smile spreads slowly across his withered grey face.
1
23,
175,The ghosts dissolve into the mists and a strange serenity soothes your tortured mind. New forms are taking shape now. They fill the scope of your vision with memories of events that occurred long ago. You see the smiling faces of your mother and father; the village of Dage, where you lived before you entered the Kai Monastery; your sister Kari calling you in for supper at the close of a warm summer's day; and the sad memory of your brother Jen, who gave his life to save yours when, on your sixth birthday, you slipped and fell into the River Tor.With amazement you watch as the patchwork parade of recollections continues to unfold, and slowly a realization of their meaning crystallizes in your mind. These people and events have all played their part, be it great or small, in the shaping of your destiny.
1
100,
176,As the clangour of arms and the ghastly howl of the attacking Chaos-creatures grow in pitch and fervour, you work feverishly to reposition the planks and make the bridge secure for the chariots to cross. Most of the damage is superficial but one stout beam that has been pulled out of place is a vital support. Without it the centre would be sure to collapse under the weight of the heavy bronze chariots.You struggle to push it back into position but it refuses to budge.
2
29,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, 
134,If you do not possess this skill, 
177,The statue is wrapped in a thin, silvery blanket of metal, its crumpled surface reflecting a glittering mosaic of light upon the rough rock walls. Carefully you peel away the metal sheeting to discover that the statue is no more than a tangle of mouldering bones, the remains of a creature long deceased. Judging by the size of the skeleton, this creature must have stood almost nine feet tall.What little it once wore has long since crumbled to dust, but lying beside the rib cage you discover a rod of silver that gleams as if it were new. If you wish to take this Silver Rod, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry tucked through your belt.
1
334,To continue, 
178,The greasy grey body is naked save for a loincloth of filthy animal hide, soaked with the black blood that gushed from its wound. In a taloned hand it grips the blowpipe, rudely fashioned from a Meledorian's thighbone. Odel curses this dead spawn of chaos and rises to his feet, clearly disturbed by what he has seen. He suggests that you head for Tolakos straight away.
1
185,
179,You race along the track and into the forest, thankful that the tangled canopy of branches offers effective protection from an attack from the air. Only when you are sure that it is safe do you stop to catch your breath and check your equipment. To your horror you discover that the creature's attack ripped open your Backpack and some of the items you were carrying have fallen out during your escape.Erase from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> those Backpack Items that appear third, fourth, and fifth on your list.
1
138,To continue, 
180,The sickly scent of the herbs makes you suspicious of their properties. Rather than risk eating any of the buds, you decide to leave and continue along the path towards the brow of the hill.
1
115,
181,You focus your concentration on the radiant power of the Lorestones and your eyes are drawn inexorably towards the ceiling. Nothing stirs in these shadowy reaches, yet you sense that the Lorestones are here. Then you notice the stair and circular portal and you realize that they must provide access to the flat roof of the Sepulchre. With your heart pounding, you race up the steps, confident of finding the two Lorestones waiting for you on the roof.
1
320,
182,You have taken only a few steps across the weathered plank bridge when a terrifying howl echoes from the surrounding trees. With a feeling of cold dread, you spin on your heel to see a lumbering horde of twisted shapes staggering from the shadows. They appear neither human nor animal but a hideous fusion of the two. T'uk T'ron and the driver run past you, their crystal swords held ready to strike. ‘Help us…we must save chariots or we all dead!' he shouts over his shoulder.
3
273,If you wish to help T'uk T'ron and his guards defend the chariots, 
176,If you decide to stay in the middle of the bridge and attempt to repair the hole, 
10,If you wish to abandon the Ookor and escape across the bridge on foot, 
183,After snatching a few hours' sleep you bid Lorkon and his warriors farewell and set off into the Nahgoth Forest. Guided by the map given to you by Serocca, you follow an old timberland path that has never before felt the tread of a man. This track leads to a place where the trees are twisted and gnarled into every conceivable shape. Some look like bent old men; others have straight trunks and curly branches; yet others are coal-black and petrified like fossils.
2
235,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination, 
292,If you do not possess this skill, 
184,Your fighting spirit seems to find favour with the leader. He is clearly impressed by your display of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and regards you with a new look of respect, the kind a warrior shows for an enemy he considers his equal. He sheathes his silver rod and calls one of his followers to step forward. With a nod of his head he commands him to fight you, and the golden-skinned giant obeys eagerly.
2
72,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
225,If you do not, 
185,There is a moment of cold fear when you first set eyes on the burial grounds of Tolakos. An eerie blue glow, cast by clumps of bacterial fungi, illuminates a mist that seeps from the tombs and crypts of this ancient necropolis. The swirling vapour is contained by a wall which encircles the graveyard, although it is broken in many places where trees have displaced the mouldering stonework. With a weapon at the ready you follow Odel towards one such gap in the wall, which is overshadowed by a great mausoleum.‘This is the Vault of Sedron,' whispers Odel, as he clambers over the rubble and crouches beside its damp grey wall. ‘Old King Kalon sleeps here.' He removes a throwing knife from his boot and with its tip he points to the other funereal landmarks of Tolakos and identifies them one by one. ‘That's the Crypt of Juilor. Over there are the Graves of the Faithful, and there's Baylon's Tomb. The Chaos-master and his minions have kept us away from here for nearly a generation, but Lorkon is determined to wrest it from him and restore it to its past glory. Over there, near the centre, is the Grand Sepulchre. That's where the bloodline of the Ironheart clan are laid to rest.'You stare at this macabre building and a powerful feeling electrifies your body. The Sepulchre is an imposing sight, yet it is not the grim splendour of its design that exhilarates you. You are ablaze with the realization that somewhere here, in the Grand Sepulchre of the Ironhearts, lie the last two Lorestones of Nyxator: the objects of your quest.
1
300,
186,A walled city of low, pyramid-shaped dwellings lies spread along the centre of a narrow, wooded valley. Near the middle, rising high above the other buildings, stands a citadel, its colour identical to the drab grey of the sky. Admiringly you observe the intricate carvings which adorn its surface, but your enthusiasm is soon dampened when you see that the streets are teeming with the creatures you encountered at the monolith. You turn to leave but a strange compulsion draws your eyes back to the citadel: it is your Kai Sixth Sense and it is telling you that Serocca, the one who can aid you in your search for the Lorestones, resides here in this tower of stone.The path leads down to an open gate in the city wall where two of its ape-like inhabitants stand guard.
2
215,If you wish to approach the city gate, 
294,If you wish to search for an unguarded entrance to the city, 
187,You are in mortal combat against a huge, swarming mass of verminous horror intent on stripping your flesh to the bone!These creatures are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
2
298,You can evade combat after three rounds by running back to the Grand Sepulchre and attempting to force your way in: 
71,If you win the combat, 
188,‘This device,' says the Beholder, pointing with pride at the huge, fiery vessel that dominates the gallery, ‘is a Dimension Door. It will enable you to pass directly into the realm of Vhozada through a rent in the fabric of the Daziarn.' You stare in awe at the sun-like ball trapped within the vessel and try to comprehend the secret sorceries that enable such a thing to exist.‘You will come to learn that the laws which govern my world are quite unlike those which shape Aon. Here, time and space can be manipulated by those with power enough to craft them to their needs,' he says, in answer to your thoughts. He wills his servant to carry him to another globe which stands close by. There he manipulates a bank of crystals and gradually a swirling circular grey shadow forms on the glassy surface of the vessel. It shimmers and you find that you cannot fully focus your eyes on it. ‘Step forward and enter,' commands the Beholder. ‘The door to Vhozada is open.'Your skin prickles and your stomach churns, but you fight to control your fear by relying solely on your Kai skills. You sense that the Beholder is speaking the truth: the grey portal does lead to the realm of Vhozada. And so, with great trepidation, you bid him farewell and step into the void.
1
208,
189,Stepping out from behind a tree, you wave and shout a greeting to the three Meledorian scouts. Instinctively they dive for cover, fearing an ambush, and one looses a bolt from a crossbow-like device strapped to his arm. The bronze-tipped quarrel whistles towards your chest with unerring accuracy.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery add 1 to this number for every Magnakai Discipline you have mastered after the first three (for example if you possess a total of five Magnakai Disciplines, add 2 to the number you have picked).

104,If your total is now 0-2, 
269,If it is 3-7, 
342,If it is 8 or more, 
190,Blasts of psychic force shoot from the shadow creatures and hurtle towards your mind, but you sense the danger and raise a psychic defence to deflect the attack. The hostile energy buckles your thought-shield and leaves you shivering with psychic shock.
2
79,If you have reached the rank of Scion-kai, 
336,If you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
191,As the power bolt lances towards your chest, you lash out and catch it a glancing blow with your Silver Rod. There is a blinding splash of colour and a fierce pain shoots up your arm, forcing you to drop the red-hot remains of the rod and snatch your blistered hand to your mouth: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.The leader gives a low, guttural laugh and steps closer to the cairn, but he is stopped in his tracks when you leap from the rocky mound and prepare to defend yourself.
1
184,
192,As you step into the pool of light surrounding the collapsed tree, you hear a faint ‘tut', as if someone nearby were spitting an insect from their mouth. Fear stabs your heart: you recognize the sound at once—it is the firing of a blow pipe!Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, add 1 to this number for every Magnakai Discipline you possess over and above the first three skills (for example if you possess six Magnakai Disciplines, add 3 to the number you have picked).

3
95,If your total score is now 0-4, 
19,If it is 5-8, 
241,If it is 9 or more, 
194,‘You bring message from Lorkon Ironheart, yes? He will help us, yes? Send many warriors, yes?' says the stumpy little creature, excitedly. You try to stall for time but your inability to answer his questions makes him suspicious. You catch the word ‘chaos' and ‘wereling' on the quiet undertone of twitterings that pass between the others, and notice that they are becoming increasingly agitated. Repeatedly the leader asks you for information until, in a fit of rage, he denounces you as an impostor. You have barely time enough to unsheathe a hand weapon as the Ookor rush forward and attack you with their spears.
1
203,If you win the combat, 
195,Quickly you enter and follow a corridor that sweeps away in a smooth, curving arc. A line of doors, each one painted with the symbol of a writhing serpent, marches past on either side. The doors are invariably closed and their heavy iron bolts are locked in position. You ignore them and hurry on towards a distant staircase, for it is here that you sense that the power of the last Lorestone is at its strongest.The staircase opens on to a balcony, which overlooks a large, circular hall. Here the floor is made of a polished, blue-black marble that gleams like the still waters of a lake. At one end stands a massive table cluttered with artefacts, scrolls, and many strange potions and powders that hint at the practice of alchemy. At the opposite end of the hall is a towering arch, its surface sculptured with all manner of creatures, many of which stir a deep loathing within you. Beneath the arch is a complete darkness: no light at all penetrates or reflects in this inky abyss, for this is the Shadow Gate of Sandai, the doorway back to your home world.
1
84,
196,T'uk T'ron and his driver jump down from the riding platform and run forward to examine the damage to the bridge. The other two chariots draw up on either side and the Ookor wait patiently for their leader to return.
2
182,If you wish to follow T'uk T'ron and examine the bridge for yourself, 
319,If you choose to stay in the chariot and await his return, 
197,Once again your Kai senses warn you that this tomb door is protected by a powerful spell. If you inscribe the wrong symbols, you will break the spell and release its destructive energies.

315,
198,You have removed your Backpack and are undoing the buckles when two hairy, clawed paws reach up, hook themselves into the soles of your boots, and drag you down. The sudden jolt makes you drop your pack into the river (delete your Backpack as well as its contents, including Meals, from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You may not acquire any Backpack Items until your Backpack has been replaced) and leaves you clinging to the beam with one hand, while trying desperately to free a weapon with the other. Your attacker—a huge, misshapen beast banded in black and brown fur—lunges repeatedly with its head as it tries to sink its fangs into your thigh.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, add 3 to the number you have picked.
2
128,If your total is now 4 or more, 
214,If it is now 3 or less, 
199,Just as the creature is poised to spring forward it hesitates. Its primeval senses detect that you are not as helpless as you seem, and a flicker of doubt passes across its cruel amber eyes. Instantly you seize the advantage and attack the beast before its appetite gets the better of its judgement.Owing to the impetus of your attack you may add 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of the fight.
1
245,If you win the combat, 
200,Perched on a bough overhanging the roof is a gigantic black-winged bird. Seated on its back is a magnificent warrior dressed in scarlet silk and polished silver mail. His head is crowned by an elaborate helmet, its visor formed in the shape of a roaring dragon with jewelled eyes and fiery breath. The tangled branches prevent the bird from landing, but a rope ladder hangs from its saddle and the warrior uses it to climb down onto the roof. He leaps the last few feet and his landing disturbs the dense mist that carpets the surface, rolling it back to reveal two glowing golden spheres of crystal, each filled with fire, lying close to where he now stands. He crouches down and your stomach churns with dread as you see him reach out to grab the golden Lorestones.
3
32,If you have a Bow and wish to fire at the warrior, 
274,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and attack him to prevent him from taking the Lorestones, 
136,If you wish to command him not to touch the Lorestones, 
201,You pull away from the dead Agtah in time to avoid the murderous leap of a snarling, dog-sized creature with large, bear-like paws. It hits the ground then leaps again and hangs on your arm, its clawed feet raking emptiness as it tries to rip your stomach. You strike a blow that opens a ragged gash in its neck but still it refuses to relinquish its grip and retaliates by sinking its fangs into your wrist: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.The creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). You may not use a Shield in this combat. If the weapon you are using to defend yourself is a Broadsword, a Quarterstaff, or a Spear, reduce your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 points for the duration of the fight.
2
254,If you win and the fight lasts three rounds or less, 
37,If you win and the fight lasts longer than three rounds, 
202,The Plain of Guakor stretches to the cloudy horizon like a vast sea of dust, broken only occasionally by a boulder or clump of wire-hard scrub. It is a drear panorama: a land once rich and fertile murdered by the curse of chaos. It instils in you a feeling of dread uncertainty at first, but as you trudge each weary mile, it slowly strengthens your determination to fulfil your quest. For the fate that has befallen Guakor will befall Sommerlund if you fail to find the last Lorestone and return to defeat Darklord Gnaag.Shortly after your second stop for rest you hear a sound far to your right. A tiny speck in the grey sky grows steadily larger until, at last, you are able to discern its shape. A cold chill runs down your spine when you recognize its dragon-like features: it is a Zhengha, the scourge of Guakor.
2
157,If you wish to try to hide from the beast, 
281,If you choose to stand your ground and await its arrival, 
203,Quickly you search the bodies of your vanquished enemies. You discover the following items which could be useful:If you decide to keep any of the items remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.
1
153,To continue, 
204,Swiftly you draw the broadsword over your head and take aim at the Chaos-master's heart, yet even as you make your lunge he catches sight of you and twists to avoid your thrust. The sharp blade opens a fearful gash in his side but it misses its vital target. With a roar of agony the evil god staggers back, dropping his club as he clasps his side. Pain swiftly turns to a rage that fills him with a lust for vengeance and, with a hideous scream, he lunges at you with his gore-stained hands.This being is immune to Mindblast (but not to Psi-surge). The Ironheart Broadsword is a magical weapon and adds 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of the fight.

302,If you win the combat, 
205,With a mighty screech, the dragonmounts take to the air in unison, the beat of their great wings filling your ears with a thunderous drumming noise. Your stomach heaves as the leader tugs at the reins, sending the beast labouring steeply into the fire-orange sky. The ground below falls away at an alarming rate and within minutes you are travelling hundreds of feet above the plateau, your vision blurred by the speed of the rushing wind.Beneath you the trackless waste stretches away to the burning horizon. Without sun or moon or any change in the brightness of the sky you find it impossible to gauge the passage of time. Twice you lapse into sleep, for how long you cannot guess, yet each time you wake the arrow-shaped flight formation of the dragonmounts remains unchanged and the Yoacor themselves show not the slightest sign of fatigue.At length the featureless wastes give way to thick, violet-coloured grasslands dotted with scab-like patches of marsh and bog. The air becomes humid and the faint smell of rotting vegetation conjures up memories of time spent in the Danarg. Gradually the lowlands rise and you soar above high valleys and rock-strewn meadows, broken hills, and weather-worn crags. As you approach a narrow cleft between two mountainous peaks the leader raises his hand. Upon this signal the others close into single file. An immense crater lies beyond the pass and at its heart stands a city, the most beautiful city you have ever seen.

50,
206,Cursing vilely, he unsheathes a curvy-bladed sword and raises it to parry your first attack. You sense that he is a formidable fighter, but his wound has left him greatly weakened. His attacks are slow and erratic and you are determined to exploit your advantage to the full.
2
306,If you reduce his <small>ENDURANCE</small> to 20 points or less, do not continue the combat but 
123,If you kill him before his <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 20 points (that is, if you score an ‘automatically killed' result on the Combat Results Table), 
207,Seated before you at a desk lit by tall candles, one set at each corner, are two pale-skinned Meledorian nobles. The flickering yellow flame glints on the fine antique workmanship of their armour and exaggerates the shadows that play on their faces as they argue their strategies for an impending battle.On seeing you enter, the conference is brought to an abrupt close. One of the officers bows and takes his leave; the other beckons a scout to approach the desk and make his report. Briefly the scout tells of how they met you and what has become of your Ookor escort. He shows the officer the Obsidian Seal given to you by Serocca before leaving the city of Thas. The officer clasps the pyramidal stone in the palm of his hand then stares directly into your eyes. A tingle of surprise prickles your skin when you return his gaze, for you notice that his eyes are misty blue, without whites or any obvious pupil.
2
159,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, 
293,If you do not possess this skill, 
208,At the very moment you enter the Dimension Door a sensation of incredible speed assails you. A twirling spiral of light unfolds before your eyes and you hurtle towards its core, borne along in an envelope of grey cloud. You close your eyes but the light penetrates your eyelids, growing ever brighter. It fills your head with a madness of colour and forces a silent scream of anguish from your lips: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.A sudden lack of air leaves you gasping for breath, but it passes in an instant and when you blink open your eyes you discover that your journey is complete: you have arrived in Vhozada.
1
228,
209,From the curved floor of this spherical chamber a billowing mist arises. It blurs your vision and numbs your senses. As if in a dream, you feel yourself lifted by the buoyant cloud and transported across a vast, shadowy terrain, where spirit-shapes, like wisps of white silk, swirl around you in continuous motion. At first you cannot discern the nature of these gossamer forms, but slowly they draw into focus until at last you are able to distinguish their features. A cold terror grips your mind when you realize exactly what it is you are looking at.
2
290,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, 
30,If you do not possess this skill, 
210,It seems as if you have only just closed your eyes when you are woken from your sleep by the sound of Serocca's voice echoing in your mind. ‘The time has come for you to begin your journey, Lone Wolf.' Quickly you dress and gather together your equipment before joining her at the Table of Visions. ‘I have chosen T'uk T'ron, my most able and trusted Ookor captain, and a company of his best Thas guards to escort you to Tolakos. He is familiar with the forest tracts of the Khat Trisect and he will ensure that you do not lose your way.'She brings forth a black box inlaid with sparkling gems and unlocks it with a star-shaped key, which she wears on a slender chain around her neck. ‘Take this, Lone Wolf, and keep it safe,' she says, handing you a pyramid-shaped Obsidian Seal.‘The war against the Chaos-master has made the Meledorians suspicious of all save their own kind, and they are wont to attack anything they fear could be an agent of chaos. When you meet them show them this seal and your safety will be assured.' (Mark the Obsidian Seal on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in your pocket. If you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible, you must discard one in favour of the Obsidian Seal.) ‘Do not speak of your quest to anyone except their leader—Lorkon Ironheart. Seek him out. In him you can place your trust. While you slept we communicated with our minds and he has vowed to help you find the Lorestones.'
1
211,
211,She puts down the black box and gracefully walks towards the narrow exit from her chamber. In the room beyond you see a stocky Ookor clad in polished bronze armour, waiting patiently for you to appear. ‘There is T'uk T'ron,' she says fondly. ‘He will be your guide.'The creature brings himself stiffly to attention and salutes you with pride. ‘I am honoured to have been chosen,' he says, using a language that approximates to your own. You return his salute then bid your thanks and farewell to Serocca.‘You will succeed,' she whispers, as she kisses your cheek. ‘You must succeed.'

4,
212,With plodding steps you set off towards the rocky cairn. Your feet sink ankle-deep into the hot red sand and you can only maintain your balance by leaning heavily into the wind. Walking soon becomes an ordeal and by the time you reach shelter you are near to exhaustion.Breathless and weary you crouch beside the mound and pray that the storm will soon subside. Then it occurs to you that the cairn is not a natural structure: the rocks have been stacked symmetrically, one upon the other, by someone or something who wished to leave their mark upon this wilderness. You examine the slabs more closely and discover one that is quite unlike the others. Its rectangular edges are even and its surface is mirror-smooth. Inscribed upon this slab are curious spidery markings.
2
44,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, 
260,If you do not possess this Magnakai Discipline, 
213,Your senses tell you that Lorkon Ironheart's army is within a league of Tolakos and will be here within the hour. Until then you must find somewhere safe from the chaos-horde or you will be overwhelmed and destroyed by sheer weight of numbers. Quickly you scan the surrounding crypts and note that, with the exception of the Grand Sepulchre and Baylon's Tomb, they are all in a state of ruin.
2
298,If you wish to attack the Chaos-creatures that are blocking the entrance to the Grand Sepulchre, 
166,If you wish to run to Baylon's Tomb and attempt to hide there, 
214,A terrible pain shoots through your lower body as the creature bites deep into your leg. Its razor-sharp teeth sever your femoral artery as it drags you down into the murky depths of the river. Weak through shock and massive loss of blood you slip rapidly from consciousness into the timeless embrace of death.
0
215,As soon as the guards see you approaching they shuffle inside and quickly shut the gate. Moments later they reappear on the battlements above, from where they direct a stream of twittering noises at you.
2
325,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the rank of Scion-kai, or if you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
337,If you do not possess either of these skills, 
216,Using your index finger you inscribe the symbols in the malleable surface of the blank square. At first nothing happens. Then your inscription begins to fade until it has vanished completely. You step back, but not quickly enough to avoid a massive charge of electrical energy, which leaps from a tiny hole above the door and stabs you in the chest: lose 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
1
25,If you survive this grievous wounding, 
217,In the gloom you are able to reach the top of the temple unseen. The vent is wide enough for you to pass through easily but the foul odour pouring out of the funnel makes you feel nauseous and dizzy (unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the fumes).A dim light glows somewhere in the depths of the shaft and the sound of grinding machinery is carried upward on the bad air. Gingerly you lower yourself down the soot-caked shaft to a place where another vent crosses it horizontally. Ten yards from this point you find a hatch. The hatch opens to reveal an empty chamber below, with several corridors radiating from it like the spokes of a wheel.
1
195,
218,You whisper a warning to your guide; then simultaneously you dive for cover behind the same tree, out of the creature's line of fire. Odel rolls over and sits with his back to the trunk while he sets the metal crossbow that is strapped to his forearm. As soon as he is ready, you leap across the gap to another tree in the hope of drawing the creature's fire. Your ploy works: the sniper fires his blowpipe at your fleeting form, missing you by a wide mark, and Odel is able to pinpoint his position. He points and fires, sending his bronze bolt deep into the scaly abdomen of an Agtah sniper—your would-be assassin. The creature gives a piercing shriek and tumbles to the ground, landing with a sickening thud near the uprooted base of Baylon's Bough.You compliment Odel on his bow-skill and rush forward, half-crouched, to search the Chaos-creature's body.
1
178,
219,The room is large and airy with tall windows that look out over the city. Far below you can see the Yoacor crowding an avenue which leads to an outer level of Yanis. They move with such purposefulness that, from this great height, they resemble a vast community of worker ants. For several hours you stare down at the beautiful alien city and its industrious citizens while you try to make sense of your situation. Eventually you resolve to find out all you can from the one the leader called the ‘Beholder'. Perhaps he will be able to help you locate the Lorestones and find a way back to Magnamund. This decided you settle down to sleep.
1
317,
220,Your Arrow arcs harmlessly over the creature's maw and disappears into the forest. Before you have a chance to reload and fire again, it swoops down and hovers menacingly above your head, its sword-like fangs poised to strike.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Owing to the speed of its attack you must fight the first round unarmed, but you may unsheathe a hand weapon for use in the second and subsequent rounds.
1
162,If you win the combat, 
221,When your shadow falls across the blue door it begins to vibrate and the surface becomes pale and cloudy. You watch in amazement as the seemingly solid slab fades and then disappears completely. Beyond the empty arch you now see a magnificent sight—a treasure vault stacked high with priceless artefacts of the Ironheart clan.
2
7,If you wish to enter this treasure vault, 
181,If you do not, 
222,The walled city of Thas, home of the Ookor, lies before you, spread out along the centre of a narrow wooded valley. The low, pyramid-shaped dwellings are built around a tower of stone, its colour identical to the drab grey of the sky. Straight thoroughfares teem with Ookor, who pass freely and leisurely through the criss-cross of narrow streets.The path leads down to an open gate in the city wall, guarded by two of the squat-limbed humanoids. When they see L'yan-K'ril and his patrol approaching with you in their midst they give a call and a crowd comes rushing out of the city. They gather round you, chirruping and twittering excitedly, while L'yan-K'ril tries his best to calm them down.
1
86,
223,Your improved Kai skill saves you from swift death by neutralizing the deadly toxins suspended in the vapour. However, when you return to the door you discover that the lock differs from that of the Grand Sepulchre in one important respect: it jams for several hours following an unsuccessful attempt at opening it. With the hordes of chaos drawing ever closer, you are forced to abandon Baylon's Tomb and search elsewhere for shelter.
3
272,If you wish to hide in the Crypt of Juilor, 
331,If you wish to hide in the Vault of Sedron, 
34,If you wish to return to the Grand Sepulchre and force your way in, 
224,You turn the three cards over and notice that a different symbol is depicted on each. The first shows a castle on a hill, the second a dragon breathing fire, and the third a black serpent with red fangs. The old crone draws patterns in the air with a crooked finger and mutters to herself unremittingly. T'uk T'ron leans forward and offers his services as translator.‘She say that you will go to a castle far away where dragon breathes fire. In this castle is a snake. Beware this snake for it is very poisonous. If it bite you—you dead!'
1
96,
225,The giant approaches, stern-faced and resolute, his huge hands poised to grab you and tear you limb from limb. Quickly you unsheathe a hand weapon and prepare to receive his attack.The giant is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
56,If you win the combat, 
226,Out of the corner of your eye you notice T'uk T'ron and his driver scurrying back to help defend the chariots. He shouts encouragement and you are about to reply when a tusked creature bounds forward and launches itself at you. You deal it a powerful blow, ripping it from chest to tail, but, as soon as it falls, another is leaping at you from the side.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
201,If you win the combat, 
227,The starving Guakor Lizard looks at you with ravenous eyes. Its lower jaw drops open to reveal a gruesome set of curved yellow fangs, and its fetid breath washes over you in a sickening wave as it launches its desperate attack.Owing to its weakened state, this creature is especially susceptible to psychic attack. Double the effect of any psychic attacks you use during the combat.
1
265,If you win the combat, 
228,From the brow of a grassy hill you stare across a strange yet familiar landscape. Before you lies an expanse of verdant grassland, with clumps of woodlands and several winding streams. The warm air smells fresh and clean and the distant sound of bird song is carried to you on the gentle breeze. Were it not for the grey, sunless skies above, it would be easy to believe that you had been returned to your home world.A sudden wave of homesickness makes you feel heavy-hearted, but you refuse to allow it to weaken your resolve. Instead, you scan the horizon in the hope of discovering some form of habitation.
2
64,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery and have reached the Kai rank of Principalin or higher, 
148,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
229,Each warrior carries a small crossbow attached by a metallic sleeve to his right forearm. The sight of these weapons, which can be fired in an instant, convinces you that it would be wise not to startle these scouts.
2
242,If you wish to call to them who you are without revealing your position, 
15,If you wish to step from the bushes with your hands above your head, 
230,The huge, winged beast soars over your position and circles twice before it loses interest in what appears to be a cluster of grey rocks. Not daring to move a muscle, you wait until you can no longer hear the beat of its wings before uncurling yourself and staggering to your feet.
1
265,
231,Being highly suspicious of your surroundings and all they contain you decide to examine them more closely. You discover nothing of interest until you search the divan: there you find a Yoacor dagger wedged deep between the cushions. Owing to the size of this weapon, if you wish to keep it, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Sword.
1
139,
232,The Meledorians are overjoyed to have witnessed the spectacular defeat of the Chaos-master, for your victory has rid them of their greatest enemy. They call to you to come down from the roof, and when you appear in the doorway, they shower you with praise.‘We owe you more than our lives, Aonian,' says Lorkon, his strange blue eyes aglow with admiration. ‘Your great deed has saved our realm and put an end to the plague of chaos that would have corrupted us all. We are forever in your debt.'
1
173,
233,‘Where is this key which allows entry to the Shadow Gate of Haagadar?' you ask, anxiously.Serocca raises her eyes from the table and smiles. ‘Power is the key, and the power is now within your grasp. The two Lorestones of Nyxator are the power—they are the key to your escape from the Daziarn. You must retrieve them from Tolakos, in the Nahgoth Forest, and then go to Haagadar. The Shadow Gate is to be found in the Temple of the Sandai at the centre of the city. I can help you reach Tolakos but beyond the Nahgoth my powers of vision grow dim. You must let your skills and this map be your guide there.'From the pocket of her silken robes she produces a Map which she presses into your hand (mark this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry inside your tunic). You unfurl the parchment and study its contents (see the accompanying illustration), noting with dismay the great distance which separates the Nahgoth Forest from the city of Haagadar.
1
238,
234,Despite their attractive aroma, the orange berries taste bitter and powdery. You force yourself to swallow and find it hard not to cough when the buds stick in your throat. Odel glances over his shoulder to see what is wrong and his face freezes in a mask of horror. ‘No!' he cries. ‘They're poisonous!'A grinding pain grips your stomach, making you double up and fall to your knees: lose 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
2
277,If you possess some Laumspur, Laumwort, or Oede herb, 
11,If you do not possess any of these items, 
235,Your senses warn you that the track leads into a section of the Nahgoth that was once occupied by the Chaos-master. The twisted trunks are evidence of the corruption he instilled in everything he touched. Although he has been defeated, it will be a long time before the scars of his corruption heal completely.
2
292,If you wish to follow the track into the chaos-zone, 
118,If you decide to leave the track and make a detour around this part of the Nahgoth, 
236,The noise of the approaching whirlwind grows steadily louder and the ground shudders violently beneath your feet. A great blast of dust and debris is sucked from the depths of the fissure. It catches you full in the chest and knocks you off balance, causing you to fall and gash your head. Blinded by the sudden pain, you are now unable to resist the full force of the whirlwind raging directly above the gully and are drawn up into the vortex never to be seen again.
0
237,Peering over the parapet, you try to locate the Lorestone, but it is impossible to see through the eerie blue carpet of grave mist. You are about to leave the roof when you hear a thrumming noise, like the sound of wild and discordant drumming. You peer in the direction of the noise and see a line of hulking shapes shambling towards the gaps in the perimeter wall. Instantly you recognize them—they are Agtah, the hideous creations of the Chaos-master.Spurred on by anger and fear, you race through the inner sanctum of the Sepulchre and skid to a halt outside its great door. There, shrouded in mist, you discover the body of your guide, his chest torn open and blackened by a bolt of power that claimed his life. You kneel to close his sightless eyes and immediately sense that the Lorestone is close at hand. Guided by instinct you race towards the Lorestone but, as you are running past the entrance to a crypt, you are set upon by a pair of snarling Chaos-creatures.
1
68,
238,‘Come, you must rest before your journey to Tolakos. I shall arrange for my Ookor to take you there after you have slept and recovered your strength.'Serocca rises from her seat and bids you follow her to an adjoining room where there is food, a bath, and a comfortable bed. There she leaves you, returning to the table to consult its visions, while you try to relax despite the heavy sense of foreboding that haunts your mind.
1
210,Restore your <small>ENDURANCE</small> to its original level, before 
239,In order to overcome this obstacle, you need to let go of the cliff-face, lean back, grab hold of the ledge, and then pull yourself up using your arms alone. Patiently you wait for a lull in the wind, but when you finally release your grip, a sudden crosswind catches you and blows you sideways. Desperately you scrabble for a handhold, but you are already falling backwards. You scream, until you smash to the ground among the boulders that litter the base of the cliff.
0
240,The creatures latch on to your scent and emit a strange, high-pitched twittering sound which alerts the others to your hiding place. You leap to your feet unsheathing a hand weapon, but before you have a chance to evade them they surround you and attack.
1
203,If you win the combat, 
241,Your Arrow flies straight and true. It pierces the Zhengha's eye and sends it soaring upwards into the sky, screeching an agonized cry across the desolate plain. At the top of its arc it breathes its last fiery breath then plummets to the ground with a resounding crash.
1
265,
242,Your words have barely left your lips before they are answered by a volley of bronze-tipped bolts, loosed in the direction of your voice. Two cut through the foliage and speed past your head, but the third is aimed lower and carves a neat notch from your thigh before disappearing into the ground: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.In the next instant the scouts explode through the undergrowth and surround you, their crossbows ready to fire again should you attempt to resist. One leans forward and pulls you roughly to your feet, demanding that you identify yourself or suffer the consequences. You tell him who you are and suggest that he look in your pocket if he requires proof that you speak the truth.

87,
243,The wheels shriek and the chariot veers wildly from side to side as it careers down the bumpy river bank.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have completed the Lore-circle of Solaris add 3 to the number you have picked.
2
57,If your total is now 0-3, 
110,If it is 4 or more, 
244,Despite the freezing wind and the near-vertical angle of ascent, your basic Kai skills enable you to climb the pitted cliff wall with little difficulty to begin with. However, when you reach the halfway point, you are faced by a ledge of sandstone that juts out several feet from the wall.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess a Rope add 1 to the number you have picked. If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery and have reached the Kai rank of Primate or higher, add 3.
2
239,If your total is now 0-4, 
279,If it is 5 or more, 
245,Slowly the slain Khozinda falls to the cavern floor, its broad tail twitching spasmodically. When finally it comes to rest you approach the carcass and examine more closely this creature of the Daziarn. Although the shape of its body appears reptilian, its scales are quite unlike those of any lizard you have seen before. They are thin yet incredibly hard and seem to be formed from a substance more akin to glass than skin or bone. You ponder the origins of this curious beast until eventually the fatigue of your ordeal catches up with you (you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Unable to resist any longer, you close your eyes and drift into a deep and dreamless sleep.
1
264,
246,From the depths of the Nahgoth Forest crawls a nightmare army of gibbering Chaos-creatures. They are directed by one sinister being and all are obedient to his silent command. You run towards the Sepulchre with terror in your heart as their writhing shapes pour through the gaps in the perimeter wall in ever increasing numbers. You evade their spears and stones but, as you reach the great door, you are confronted by three tentacled horrors, wearing heavy armour strapped to their warty hides. Their bloated bodies fill the doorway and prevent you from entering.
3
213,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Divination, Huntmastery, or Pathsmanship, 
298,If you possess none of these skills, you can either attack the three creatures: 
55,Or you can evade them and search elsewhere for a place to hide: 
247,The cool gloom of the Nahgoth Forest floor seems to continue indefinitely. Then you arrive at a place where one of the massive trees has fallen and torn a gap in the canopy of leaves. There the gloom is brightened by a narrow column of light.‘That's Baylon's Bough,' whispers Odel, pointing at the decaying trunk. ‘Just another league and we'll be at Tolakos.'
2
59,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the Kai rank of Tutelary or higher, 
192,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
248,The stream wends its way sluggishly through a mossy glen to a thicket of red-leaved trees which stand in a semicircle around a pale grey, metallic monolith.
2
275,If you wish to investigate this strange monolith, 
53,If you choose to avoid it, 
249,The Arrow strikes the ornate dragon which decorates the visor of his helmet, and shatters in two against its hardened steel. He utters a mocking laugh, his green, cat-like eyes glinting through the visor slits, and hurriedly drops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt. Angered by his laugh, and your failure, you shoulder your Bow and draw a hand weapon as you run forward to prevent his escape.
1
22,
250,The flickering patterns draw into focus and you see before you a panoply of strange scenes, and the faces of many unknown creatures, some human, some bestial, and some that defy description.‘Many of the events which have befallen your world are mirrored here in the Daziarn,' says Serocca, as you watch, with growing fascination, the image of a battle taking place between men and beasts. ‘We too are threatened by the forces of darkness. Many ages ago we triumphed over evil, but our victory was incomplete. Now our nemesis has come in the guise of the Chaos-master. Everywhere his seething corruptions encroach upon the goodly realms of the Daziarn, twisting and consuming all they touch.'The vision of the battle fades and is replaced by a living map, similar to the light-picture you were shown by the Beholder of Yanis. ‘Here are the realms that lie between the elemental strongholds of Earth and Water. Once this region was rich and populous with the creatures of light, but now it lies ravaged by the cancerous Realm of Paradox. Only Vhozada and Meledor continue to resist; the others have either disappeared into the Neverness or been transformed into desolate wastelands. Here…' she says, pointing to the middle of the table, ‘is the Nahgoth Forest, once the most fertile of the great timberlands; now the scourge of chaos splits it asunder. And here, the Plain of Guakor, the mightiest realm the Daziarn has ever known, reduced to dust by a plague of fire-breathing Zhengha.'Tears well up in her eyes and you sense that the vision of Guakor has stirred painful memories.
2
288,If you wish to ask what troubles her, 
345,If you choose not to intrude on her grief, 
251,You leave the treasure vault and recommence your search for the Lorestones. You concentrate on the source of their radiant power and your eyes are drawn inexorably towards the ceiling. Nothing stirs in these shadowy reaches, yet you sense that the Lorestones are there. Then you notice the stairs and the circular portal and at once you realize that they must provide access to the flat roof of the Sepulchre. With your heart pounding in your chest you race up the steps, confident of finding the two objects of your quest waiting for you on the roof.
1
320,
252,Your advanced Magnakai skill enables you to understand what these beings are saying. One demands to know why you are violating the sacred burial tomb of Ztuul, one of their most revered hunters, and the other asks how you came to be here, alone and without any means of transportation. You sense that they speak not in their native tongue but in a language they assume to be yours.
2
156,If you wish to tell them that you are from the world of Magnamund and that you arrived here after having fallen through a Shadow Gate, 
280,If you choose to ignore their questions and remain silent, 
253,A loud <i>click</i> issues from the lock and the portal creaks open to reveal a long, dark corridor. Quickly you step inside and swing shut the heavy door to deny entry to the screaming horde of Chaos-creatures assembling outside. Tubes of green glass set into niches in the wall cast a faint glow by which you can see your way to the chamber at the heart of the tomb. Here lie the remains of Baylon, ancient ruler of Meledor, encased in a sarcophagus of gleaming, gem-studded silver.To the rear of the chamber you notice a stair that ascends to the ceiling where, like the Grand Sepulchre, there is a circular portal that gives access to the roof.
3
154,If you wish to search the chamber, 
66,If you wish to investigate the sarcophagus, 
27,If you choose instead to go up on the roof and spy on the advancing horde, 
254,T'uk T'ron runs to your side, his face and crystal sword spattered with the black blood of his foes. ‘Hurry! This fight lost. You go…go now!' he snaps, and points across the bridge to the hills beyond. A cursory glance confirms his grim statement. Only he and two of his guards remain standing and one fights left-handed, his right arm swinging broken and useless by his side. The others, including all the onipa, have been slain by the howling creatures of chaos.Reluctantly you obey T'uk T'ron's command and hurry across the bridge, whilst he and his brave Ookor guards fight to cover your escape. Not until you reach the first ridge of hills do you look back at the bridge, hoping to see T'uk T'ron and his guards victorious. But your hope is in vain—all that remains alive at the bridge is a ghoulish grey horde of feasting Agtah.

114,
255,Drawing on your powerful healing skills you cause a surge of anti-toxins to be released into your bloodstream to combat the effects of the poison. Swiftly the deadly venom is neutralized and your metabolism returns to normal.
1

256,You crouch down, making use of the cover afforded by a leafy tree, and draw an Arrow to your lips. Two of the creatures have clambered through the foliage and halted less than ten paces away, offering themselves as perfect targets. You release your bowstring and send the shaft thudding into the chest of one, knocking it backwards with the force of the shot. Instantly, its companion emits a strange, high-pitched twittering sound, alerting the others to your position, and before you can either reload or run away, they close in from all sides and attack.Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, deduct 2 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the first round of combat, owing to the speed of your enemy's attack.

203,If you win the combat, 
257,The great, silvery-winged worm swoops down and hovers above your head, lunging sporadically to stab you with its long, sword-sharp fangs.The creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
162,If you win the combat, 
258,The captain shrugs his hairy shoulders and motions to the driver not to stop. As you pass through the village, a group of Ookor children cheer and wave and toss flowers at the speeding chariots. One of the red blooms lands in the crook of your arm.

74,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Curing, 
143,If you do not possess this skill, 
259,Suddenly the guards spring into action, drawing their jagged swords and raising them in readiness to strike. Your bluff has not deceived them and they are determined to capture you—dead or alive!
1
195,If you win the combat, 
260,Much of the porous rock that surrounds the slab has been eroded by wind and sand. Holes have appeared through which you can see into the cairn. It is hollow. Curiosity and the need for better shelter prompt you to try to dislodge the slab and, after much effort, you pull it free, leaving an opening the size of a trapdoor in the side of the mound.Inside the gloomy interior you discover a large, metallic statue lying horizontally on a bed of clear, crystalline sand. You try to perceive some detail but the shape is shrouded in near darkness.

177,If you possess a Kalte Firesphere, a Lantern, or a Torch and Tinderbox, and wish to illuminate this dark interior, 
334,If you do not possess any of the above items, or if you do not wish to make use of them, 
261,The wine has been charmed with a potent magical spell, imbuing it with special healing properties. Having drunk one draught, there are now only two draughts remaining in the Silver Flask. Each draught restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the beneficial effect of the draught you have just drunk).

323,
262,The vision of the Nahgoth Forest dissolves and a new one takes its place. It is of a city, perched atop a rocky cliff, surrounded by a wall fortified with towers and grim bastions. Red flames glare from a row of tiny windows and its huge stone gate is emblazoned with the symbol of a fiery dragon.‘This is Haagadar,' says Serocca, cheerlessly. ‘Once it was the home of the Sandai, the rulers of the Great Plains that stretched to the very edge of the strongholds of Earth. They were the first to fall to chaos and now their plains are dead and empty wastelands of sterile rock and poisoned sand. Haagadar was claimed by the Chaos-master and it became his abode but, as his foul empire expanded, he grew tired of it and abandoned it for other, less remote, cities. It lay deserted for an age before outlaws and refugees from Guakor sought sanctuary there from the creatures of chaos. It is now a forgotten city, yet within its heart there lies a secret that even the Chaos-master failed to discover: the Sandai were the guardians of a Shadow Gate. Long had they kept hidden this portal whilst they searched for a means to enter it, for unlike the Shadow Gates of your world, those of the Daziarn are closed. Only those who possess a key can pass from this realm into the universe of Aon.'

233,
263,Your shaft penetrates his chainmail at an angle, ripping through his padded underjacket and cutting across his chest. The force of the Arrow stuns him momentarily and he cries out in pain. But the pain does not prevent him from scooping the Lorestones into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt. Quickly you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon as you rush forward to prevent his escape.
1
97,
264,You wake with a start, stirred to consciousness by the distant flap of large wings beating in a windless sky. The sounds grow louder and quickly you gather up your equipment and hurry out of the cavern to investigate their source.The storm died down while you slept and the plateau is now becalmed. From the rim of the gully you can see six black shapes silhouetted on the blazing horizon. They resemble dragons with snaky necks and ragged bat-like wings. Upon their backs they carry gold-skinned creatures, human in appearance save for their lack of hair and their massive size.The leader sees you: he banks his dragonmount towards the gully and the others follow closely in his wake. You fear they are about to attack, but at the last moment they veer away and circle the gully before landing nearby. With practised ease the leader and two of his brothers dismount from their winged steeds. They each dwarf you by an arm's length, and, although their heavy muscular bodies seem incapable of stealth, they approach like lions stalking their prey. <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Zeeu klo-ka n'ra?'</i> speaks the leader, his voice deep and resonant. <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Ryl'aan noorna?'</i> says another, impatiently.

305,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have attained the Kai rank of Scion-kai, 
132,If you do not possess this Magnakai Discipline or have yet to reach this level of training, 
265,After your encounter you stop to rest less frequently. Mile after mile you plod on mechanically, only half aware of the lifeless landscape through which you move. Fatigue dulls your senses and you cannot recall the exact moment you entered the Neverness; like a dream, it is as if you have always been here. Clouds swirl beneath your feet yet they support your weight. You float in a sea and sky of grey light without horizon or boundary, a limitless eternity of space. There are distant sounds, like muffled voices, but when you strive to understand them they fade and you cannot catch the words.Time passes, yet time is meaningless, for you cannot tell the order in which events are taking place. From out of the swirling wisps of cloud three globes of darkness arise. They swim closer, hovering to and fro, evolving into the forms of black-hooded riders on demon steeds. Leering skulls peer from the shadow of their cloaks and you see your own eyes reflected in their bony sockets.

190,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, 
81,If you do not possess this skill, 
266,You snatch the reins from the startled driver and pull hard to the left, steering the onipa team clear of the bridge. But your action does not slow them down and you find yourself racing headlong towards the river. With terrified cries, both T'uk T'ron and the driver cover their eyes as the muddy water looms into view.

267,‘Luck be with you, Aonian,' says Lorkon, as you turn to leave his cabin. ‘Remember, I will be marching to Tolakos as soon as my reinforcements arrive.'You thank him and bid him farewell, before following Odel the scout as he wends his way through the busy encampment to the equipment tent. Two grim-faced guards bar your entry, but when Odel tells them on whose authority you are here, they quickly lower their spears and allow you to pass. The tent is full of weapons and provisions and Odel suggests that you take whatever you need. You may select from the following:If you wish to keep any of these items remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.

285,To continue, 
268,The swirling light draws into focus upon the mirrored floor and you find yourself surrounded by a spectacular cosmic image. At the centre spins a shadow, as dark as deep space, populated with suns and stars and the myriad planets that revolve about them. This microscopic universe is in turn surrounded by a ring of total darkness, and beyond that radiate four beams of differing colour, like the spokes of a gigantic wheel. Between these beams are many areas of light and shade, some running parallel and some in isolation, but all of them connected by a pale, shimmering mist. ‘What you see before you is a tableau of our worlds, a light-painting that depicts the universe of Aon and the Daziarn Plane,' says the Beholder, as his servant carries him to the dark centre of the floor. ‘Here, among the suns and stars of Aon, is the planet you know as Magnamund, and beyond it lies the Shadow Gate through which you fell into the Daziarn.' Slowly the Yoacor moves towards you, bearing his master with care as he continues his monologue proudly. ‘And here, balanced between the elemental strongholds of Fire and Water, lies the Abaxial of Czenos. This is my realm. I have chosen to live here, to shape it as I wish and to populate it with beings who embody my ideals.'Coldly the Beholder stares into your eyes and you feel your body stiffen as he probes deep into your mind.

174,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, 
102,If you do not possess this skill, 
269,You twist aside and the bolt scrapes a line of flesh from your ribs before embedding itself in the trunk of a tree behind: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.Stifling a cry of pain, you drop to your knees and crawl rapidly through the undergrowth, lest they fire at the place where you fell. You stop just long enough to staunch the blood from your wound but, as you are about to continue, the scouts burst through the foliage and surround you, their bows held ready to finish you off. One reaches down and pulls you roughly to your feet, demanding that you identify yourself or suffer the consequences. You tell him who you are and suggest that he look in your pocket if he requires proof that you speak the truth.

87,
270,You focus your energy on the approaching shadows and prepare to engage them in psychic combat.Conduct this mind combat following normal combat procedure, although, in this instance, Weaponskill bonuses cannot be used to increase your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score. Instead, for every Magnakai Discipline you possess over and above the first three skills, you may add 1 point to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of the fight. Also, if you possess a Psychic Ring, or a Grey Crystal Ring, you may add a further 3 points (per item) to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> bonus for using a Shield does not apply here, nor do any bonuses for using Alether or any weapon-like Special Items such as the Sommerswerd.

149,If you win the combat, 
271,The lizard beast yawns, exposing a wickedly curved beak and a jaw set with dagger-sharp fangs. It snickers evilly, relishing the thought of killing and devouring you at its leisure.
2
322,If you possess a Bow and wish to use it, 
31,If you do not, 
272,On reaching the crypt you find it overrun by bloated, toad-like monstrosities with huge heads and mottled, glistening skins. They croak and growl hungrily as they latch on to your scent.

2,If you possess a Fireseed and wish to throw it, 
103,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and fight these toad-like horrors, 
298,If you decide to run back to the Grand Sepulchre and attack the three creatures that block its entrance, 
273,You reach the chariots just as the first wave of Chaos-creatures launch their attack. Raging viciously, they slaver in for the kill, fighting with fang and claw and yellowed tusk. A screaming horror, its body striped with ochre lines, leaps from the back of a startled onipa and hurtles towards you with its crimson jaw gaping wide. You tense yourself in readiness to strike as its shadow falls upon your face.The creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Owing to the speed and ferocity of its attack, you cannot evade combat or make use of a Bow.
1
201,If you win the combat, 
274,The speed and determination of your attack takes your adversary by surprise. Before he can scoop the Lorestones into a small velvet sack hanging from his sword belt, you strike a blow that causes him to back away hastily. An intoxicating rush of energy washes over your body as you step within a few feet of the Lorestones, but this charge momentarily numbs your reflexes, leaving you unprepared for your enemy's response. He unsheathes a curvy-bladed sword and launches a flurry of blows aimed at your head, forcing you to duck and retreat to avoid instant decapitation. He takes this opportunity to stoop down and drop the Lorestones in the sack before springing forward, like a big cat, to continue the fight.
2
306,If you reduce his <small>ENDURANCE</small> to 20 points or less, do not continue the combat but 
123,If you kill him before his <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 20 (that is, if you score an ‘automatically killed' result on the Combat Results Table), 
275,The base of the monolith is overgrown with weeds and wild flowers, indicating that it has stood here for some considerable time, yet its metallic surface bears no obvious signs of weathering. It is tipped with a transparent spike, which resembles a short glass spear. You can hear a faint humming sound when you place your ear to its mirror-smooth spire. The sound seems to originate somewhere deep below the ground.

283,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have attained the Kai rank of Tutelary or higher, 
6,If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
276,At length you emerge from the marsh at a place where a track cuts through the forest. You follow this rough, timberland trail until, after countless hours, you arrive at the edge of the Plain of Guakor. You are now extremely tired and must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Rather than attempt an immediate crossing of this barren waste, you decide to rest here and continue after some much needed sleep.Ten hours later you awake refreshed and eager to begin the next leg of your journey to Haagadar. After checking your equipment and your map, you set off across the featureless plateau.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.

318,If the number you have picked is 0-2, 
202,If it is 3-9, 
277,Through gritted teeth, you tell Odel to remove the healing potion from your pack and empty its contents into your mouth. Swiftly he complies and within a few seconds the painful stomach cramps subside and you begin to recover your strength as the potion neutralizes the deadly toxin.Odel wipes the sweat from his brow and breathes a sigh of relief. The Meledorians have no known cure for Khetu poisoning, and for a moment he feared you were going to die.If you wish to collect a handful of these deadly Khetu Spores, mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.

247,
278,You draw your weapon and stand poised to strike down any who would dare come within range. The chariots screech to a halt and a score of Ookor guards leap from the riding platforms. They come scurrying towards you, their glass-tipped spears thrust before them. Their leader motions to you to sheathe your weapon or face the consequences. You ignore his signals and get ready to attack him. Then you see more chariots emerge from the city to reinforce the patrol. With the odds stacked so heavily in their favour reluctantly you decide to raise your hands and allow these ape-men to march you into their city under heavy guard.
1
86,
279,With panther-like grace you swing clear of the cliff wall, grab hold of the ledge with both hands, and pull yourself over the obstacle. The remainder of the climb is easy by comparison and you soon reach the top to find yourself standing in the shadow of the huge dragon gate. Two iron-banded doors set into the stone offer access to the city. They are unguarded and you enter and walk undetected along the flagstoned street beyond.Few walk the shadowy avenues of Haagadar; the atmosphere is so thick with the smell of salt and sulphur that those whom you do pass are unrecognizable behind the damp pads they press to their faces to ward off the cloying stench. The dimly lit street ends at a central square where you witness two encouraging sights. Roped to a stone monolith at the centre of the square is a huge, black bird—the scarlet warrior's winged steed. Behind it, rising in flat-topped tiers, is the Temple of the Sandai. Two armour-clad creatures stand guard at the entrance, their rusty helmets crudely adapted to fix their face pads in position. You sense that the Lorestone is here within the temple, and you scan every inch of it in the hope of finding an unguarded entrance. There are no other doors, but a circular, chimney-like vent protrudes from the middle of the highest tier.
2
217,If you decide to climb to the top of the temple and attempt an entry through the vent, 
38,If you wish to cover your face and attempt to bluff your way past the guards, 
280,The golden-skinned giants scowl with disdain when you offer no reply. Their leader draws a silver rod from his lizard-scale vest, levels it menacingly at your chest, and slowly repeats the words he has spoken.
2
39,If you possess a Silver Rod, 
67,If you do not possess this Special Item, 
281,The Zhengha approaches with deadly grace, its huge, grey-green wings bearing it along at marvellous speed. Wisps of smoke trail from its fanged mouth and its emerald eyes sparkle like a pair of evil jewels. It circles you once to consider its action before diving to attack.
2
193,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
62,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and prepare to defend yourself, 
282,The two Ookor scurry across the planks and you follow closely on their heels, running half-crouched to make use of the cover afforded by the parapet of the bridge. You reach the centre of the bridge and are relieved to see that the damage is not beyond repair; whoever did this wanted to delay not destroy. T'uk T'ron signals to his guards to come and lend a hand with the repairs, but as soon as they leave the chariots a chilling howl echoes from the nearby trees. ‘Agtah!' moans T'uk T'ron, his voice a whisper of fear. ‘Creatures of chaos!'A shiver runs down your spine when you see them. Lumbering hordes of twisted shapes lurch from the trees on either side of the bridge and stagger drunkenly towards the chariots. They appear to be neither animal nor human but a ghastly fusion of the two. Now only two drivers remain with the onipa teams and T'uk T'ron is quick to see the danger. He commands the guards to return and leads them back across the bridge with his crystal sword held high.
3
273,If you wish to follow T'uk T'ron and help him defend the chariots, 
176,If you decide to stay where you are and attempt to repair the bridge, 
10,If you wish to abandon the Ookor and escape across the bridge on foot, 
283,Your Kai skill alerts you to the possibility of an ambush. A group of hostile creatures are approaching the thicket, drawn by the sound of an alarm, inaudible to human ears, which you set off by touching the monolith.
2
135,If you wish to evade these creatures, 
343,If you decide to stay and confront them, 
284,You take aim at the creature's gaping maw as it comes sweeping down to attack.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, and add to it any missile bonuses you may have.
3
220,If your total is now 0-4, 
127,If it is 5-8, 
21,If it is 9 or more, 
285,Odel replenishes a quiver of bolts that he carries on his hip and checks that the crossbow he wears strapped to his forearm is functioning properly. Satisfied, he folds away its hinged bow arms, and then slips a brace of throwing knives into the tops of his boots. ‘Are you ready?' he asks, as you finish adjusting your equipment. ‘Yes,' you reply, confidently. ‘Let's go.'You leave the encampment by slipping over the perimeter wall, and quickly merge like shadows into the thick forest beyond. The giant trunks support a canopy of dense foliage that blocks out most of the light and keeps the forest floor bathed in a perpetual twilight. A carpet of moss muffles your footfalls and the only foliage that grows in abundance is a bushy velvet lichen patterned with orange-headed, tooth-sized growths.
2
36,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing, 
163,If you do not possess this skill, 
286,Your Arrow tears into its eye, splitting it open like a burst egg. It ends its flight buried deeply in the creature's brain, bringing death in an instant and sparing the beast the agony of its terrible wound.
1
245,
287,Despite his attempts to save himself, your shaft penetrates his chainmail vest and sinks deep into his side. He screams in pained surprise before wrenching the offending shaft from his body and hurling it back at you with contempt. His fortitude is impressive but you can tell that he has suffered a serious wound. Feverishly he scoops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt, while you shoulder your Bow, draw a hand weapon, and run forward to prevent his escape.
1
206,
288,‘It is the cruelty of the Chaos-master that saddens me so,' she says in a whisper, as if fearing to be overheard. ‘Before his coming, the Plain of Guakor was ruled by a great warrior called Sinay, whose only fault, it was said, was a surfeit of pride. He loved me and wished for the union of our realms, but, alas, his love was unrequited; the joining of Guakor and Vhozada was not to be. To win my love and restore his injured pride, Sinay struck a bargain with the Chaos-master, for in keeping with the paradoxical nature of that god, he is obliged to indulge in the granting of wishes to those who would dare demand them of him. The Chaos-master wove a spell to enchant me and Sinay was granted his wish: I became enamoured of him. But the bargains of the Chaos-master are in keeping with his nature—they are cruel and fickle. Upon the hour of our wedding he appeared and demanded that Sinay pay for his wish by ceding him half his realm. He was refused, and in retribution he imprisoned me here in this tower and wrought upon Sinay such physical mutation that he fled Guakor and hid himself in shame.'‘Do you know what became of him?' you ask.‘Yes,' she replies, sadly. ‘He is the ruler of a new realm. He has regained his power but his body is forever a cruel reminder of his pact with the Chaos-master. He is the one who sent you to me—he is the Beholder of Yanis.'
1
345,
289,You watch the dead beast splash into the water, and then focus your attention on the battle now raging around the chariots. The situation looks desperate: T'uk T'ron and his guards are hard-pressed to keep the Chaos-creatures from breaking through to the bridge. You see the Ookor captain slay a loping, pig-like monster; then he moves towards you, waving his sword and shouting something you cannot hear clearly.
2
254,If you wish to find out what T'uk T'ron is saying, 
10,If you decide to abandon the Ookor and his guards and escape across the bridge, 
290,The ghostly forms possess the faces of every enemy you have ever slain. They twist and contort beneath your gaze, their empty eyes burning with cold blue flames as they return your stare. Frantically you draw on your psychic reserves and succeed in shielding your mind from the shock of this haunting confrontation.
1
175,
291,You focus your Kai skill on the Beholder and try to fathom if his intentions are for good or ill. You sense he possesses immense powers, both physical and psychic, which radiate from his body like the rays of an invisible sun. You concentrate on this power but all you can discern is that he is capable of using it to further both good and evil.
1
152,
292,As you continue along the track, the strange trees make you feel uneasy, doubly so because they are totally motionless. Soon you come to a clearing where a large bore-hole has obliterated the path. You decide to investigate the hole and, as you peer into the blackness, you hear a thin, wailing cry far below.
2
141,If you wish to shout into the hole, 
138,If you wish to hurry away from the hole and leave the clearing, 
293,A gush of psychic energy floods your mind. It washes over your thoughts, searching for some evidence of hostile intent. You fight to resist this intrusion and the wave quickly recedes, but it leaves you shivering with the chill of psychic shock: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
1
314,
294,You hurry towards the woods that line the valley, hoping the trees will hide you from the watchful eyes of the guards as you skirt the city wall. But your presence has already been noted by a lookout stationed high in the grey tower, who saw you standing at the top of the hill. He has sent word to the gate guards to prepare a special patrol.Five chariots, drawn by fearsome beasts that are only a little like horses, charge out of the city and come thundering across the grassland. Your first reaction is to run for the forest, but the chariots are moving at a terrific pace and you know they could ride you down before you reached the trees. Their riders whoop with glee as they spread out to encircle you.
3
46,If you have a Bow and wish to use it, 
278,If you wish to unsheathe a hand weapon and prepare to defend yourself, 
94,If you decide to raise your hands in surrender, 
295,Your Kai skill saves you from ending your days in the stomach of this giant Guakor Lizard. It growls menacingly, before turning and retreating to the shelter of its lair among the boulders.
1
265,
296,Silently you slip your Bow from your shoulder and draw an Arrow. The creature is close: you can sense it getting ready to pounce. Then, with matchless speed and skill, you twist around and shoot your Arrow beneath the bridge. A loud yelp of pained surprise issues from below and you catch a glimpse of a hairy, misshapen creature tumbling into the river with your shaft driven deep into its forehead.
1
289,
297,The torrid winds sweep across the landscape with increasing ferocity, forcing you to protect your eyes from the gusts of sharp, stinging sand. The need to find cover takes priority when you sense that the winds are merely the prelude to a storm. To remain here in the open could prove a fatal mistake.Peering through your fingers you try to find somewhere to take shelter. To your left, in the middle distance, you can see what appears to be a mound of volcanic stone slabs; to your right, but further away, you notice a shallow gully running lee to the wind.
2
212,If you wish to take shelter behind the mound of stones, 
89,If you decide to shelter in the gully, 
298,The three creatures bellow and growl as your blows find their way between their plates of armour, and they retaliate by lashing you with their suckered tentacles. Their attacks are ill-aimed and clumsy, but wherever one of their rubbery limbs touches your body it leaves an angry red weal.Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, add 2 to any <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses you sustain during this combat, owing to the poisonous lash of their tentacles.
2
166,If you have not already visited Baylon's Tomb, you may evade combat at any time by running towards it: 
133,If you win the combat, 
299,You jump clear and hit the bank with a jolt that leaves you breathless. The ground is soft but there are many boulders embedded along the river's edge and, as you roll down the slope, you cannot avoid colliding with some of them.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, deduct 2 from the number you have picked.If your total is now 3 or less, lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If it is 4-6, lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If it is 7-9, lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

165,Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> before 
300,‘I must search that tomb,' you say, staring fixedly at the huge door that dominates the Sepulchre's blue-grey sculptured facade. Odel frowns and casts his eyes nervously at the surrounding mist. ‘I cannot enter,' he says. ‘I am not of clan blood. If you choose to go through that door you must go alone.'You sense that nothing will induce Odel to break his clan law, but you are anxious not to lose a valuable guide. ‘When I enter the Grand Sepulchre will you wait for me here?', you ask, hoping he will agree. Silently he considers your request. ‘Yes,' he says, without enthusiasm. ‘But search swiftly. The creatures of chaos are close. I can feel it in my blood.'You exchange stern smiles then hurry away through the knee-deep mists, towards the great door.
1
131,
301,The area around the monolith is deserted, but it is not long before the ape-like creatures step from the shadows of the trees and surround you in a wide circle. One of their number utters a strange twittering sound, and then narrows his eyes and tilts his head from side to side as if he expects you to answer his call.
2
309,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the rank of Scion-kai, or if you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
108,If you have neither of these skills, 
302,As your blade cleaves his black heart in two, the Chaos-master gives voice to an unearthly howl, loud enough to waken the dead. His great body stiffens and his skin writhes and shimmers, making it impossible to discern any detail. Then suddenly it fades until all that remains to record that he ever existed is the lingering stench of his spilt blood.
1
144,
303,You pull away from the packleader and roll under a chariot to avoid its continued attack. But it is determined to kill you and, with a shrill howl, it launches itself blindly at your legs. You avoid the lunge and scramble to your feet, your weapon poised to strike as soon as your pursuer appears. Snarling, the green face bobs out close to the wheel. For an instant its red eyes glare insanely, before, with one swift blow, you cleave its scaly neck in two.
1
254,
304,Your reflexes save you from the deadly dart—it hisses past your head and buries itself harmlessly in the soft forest floor. Odel spins on his heel and points at the canopy of branches with an outstretched arm. There is a metallic twang, and the steel drawstring of his crossbow propels its bolt deep into the scaly belly of an Agtah sniper perched high above. It utters a piercing shriek and tumbles to the ground with a sickening thud.You compliment your guide on his bow-skill and join him as he moves forward to search the dead body.
1
178,
305,Your much improved Kai skill enables you to understand the language that these beings are speaking. They want to know why you are trespassing on their hunting ground and how you came to be here, alone and without any means of transportation. You sense that they speak not in their native tongue but in a language they assume to be yours.
2
156,If you wish to tell them that you are from the world of Magnamund and that you arrived here after falling through a Shadow Gate, 
132,If you choose to ignore their questions and remain silent, 
306,Breathless and bleeding, the warrior evades your skilful attacks by leaping for the rope ladder and holding fast. From there he shouts a command and the giant black bird takes to the air, lifting him off the roof. A wave of panic engulfs you. In desperation you leap up and strike a blow at the velvet sack swinging from his belt. He tries to fend off your attack but his position is precarious. Your blow strikes home, slitting open the velvet and gashing deep into the back of his gloved hand. He drops his sword and one of the two Lorestones tumbles from the sack and falls into the graveyard below, coming to rest close to the door of the Sepulchre. Yet he manages to save the second Lorestone from falling and, with a parting curse, you watch as he is lifted above the trees and carried away into the cold, grey sky.

237,
307,The cards you have drawn from the pack are marked with varied and colourful symbols. The first shows a bed, the second a young Ookor child, and the third a sword. The aged fortune teller weaves her crooked fingers around the cards. She mutters incessantly to herself and T'uk T'ron is obliged to act as her translator.‘She say you will dream of when you were young. In your dream much will be made clear to you. This dream is good. It will help you grow strong and defeat your enemies.'

96,
308,Your mastery of dialect and mannerisms convinces them that you are one of the minions who serve the Master of the City. Slowly they step aside, sniggering like spiteful children as they watch you enter the temple door. You glance back to see one draw a warty forefinger across his throat, and hear the other laugh.
1
195,
309,Your Kai Mastery enables you to understand the bizarre language these creatures use. The one who spoke introduced himself as L'yan-K'ril, an elder of the Ookor. He then asked if you came from somewhere called Meledor, and from the tone of his voice you get the distinct impression that he is hoping you will answer ‘yes'.
3
194,If you wish to answer ‘yes', 
16,If you wish to answer ‘no', 
108,If you choose to say nothing, 
310,You dive to avoid the gout of yellow flame that shoots from its mouth, but it catches your feet and legs and you suffer extensive burns: lose 7 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
1
329,If you survive this wounding, 
311,You sense that Serocca is imprisoned in a cage of psychic energy which surrounds her chamber and prevents her from passing through the opening. This energy is extremely powerful and has been synchronized to react to her brainwaves alone. To enter the chamber would cause you no injury, but if she ever attempted to pass through the invisible wall, the resulting release of force would be enough to destroy both her and the entire city of Thas.

58,
312,Waves of raw psychic energy radiate from the golden sphere, hovering motionless above the tower. Your highly developed spirit skills enable you to tap this energy and use it to replenish lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> (in this instance 0 = 10). The number you have picked indicates the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you are able to restore to your current total.
1
106,Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> before 
313,The uneven floor is riddled with deep pot-holes which impede your progress. Unless you have completed the Lore-circle of Solaris, you must deduct 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to injuries sustained to your legs. At length the narrow fissure widens and, as your eyes become accustomed to the gloom, you are able to detect that a small cavern lies ahead. Just at this moment a rumbling cacophony surges along the fissure and the floor shudders and heaves beneath your feet. Then a great blast of dust and debris knocks you off balance as it is sucked out of the cavern by the whirlwind now raging directly above. The turmoil soon subsides but, as you drag yourself to your feet, you notice that you are not alone.

161,
314,With a gesture of his hand Lorkon Ironheart dismisses the scouts and you are left alone in his company.‘So you are the Aonian for whom Mistress Serocca would have me postpone the war against chaos,' he says sardonically, reaching for a decanter of ruby red wine. He fills two crystal goblets and offers one to you. ‘Let us toast the success of your treasure hunt,' he says, raising his glass on high.‘And to your triumph over chaos,' you add diplomatically.He smiles as he sips the bitter vintage and you regard each other with thoughtful curiosity. He has a youthful face, with high cheek-bones, narrow jaw, and a thin, chiselled, aristocratic nose. His silver hair is a mass of silken threads flowing from beneath the rim of his ornate conical helmet to fan across his wide shoulders and thick, vermilion cloak. But it is his eyes that fascinate you most, for they are filled with knowledge and ancient wisdom.You talk at length about events which have brought you to the Nahgoth Forest in search of Lorkon's help, and in return he tells you of the dangers you may face at Tolakos.

315,Below are shown four groups of symbols. One of these, when inscribed upon the blank square, will complete the sequence and open the lock that secures Baylon's Tomb. Study the symbols carefully and compare them with those shown in the illustration accompanying <a href="#sect166">entry 166</a>.When you think you have found the correct group of symbols, turn to the entry given below it:

253,If you believe B completes the sequence, 
125,If you believe C completes the sequence, 
88,If you believe D completes the sequence, 
316,Suddenly two hairy, clawed paws reach up, hook themselves into the backs of your legs, and drag you through the hole in the bridge. You swing in the void, clinging to the beam with one hand while trying desperately to free a weapon with the other. Your attacker, a huge, misshapen beast banded in black and brown fur, lunges repeatedly with its head as it tries to sink its sharp fangs into your thigh.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, add 3 to the number you have picked.
2
128,If your total is now 4 or more, 
214,If it is now 3 or less, 
317,A strong hand on your shoulder shakes you roughly from your sleep. ‘The Beholder requests your company,' says the Yoacor leader stepping back and motioning you to rise. ‘You must come with me.'Together with six attendant guards, the leader escorts you from the watchtower, across an open courtyard paved with polished steel, and into the entrance hall of the crystal citadel. There a superb spiral staircase forms the central core of this stronghold, carved from a solid mountainous chunk of a sky-blue mineral unfamiliar to you. The stairs soar upwards towards the turreted roof where the chamber of the Beholder is situated.With ease the Yoacor ascend and you struggle to keep pace. You count over 300 steps before the staircase opens on to a silent hallway where a massive door of solid ebony inlaid with gold fills an entire wall. A bell is rung and while you catch your breath and wait for the massive door to open you speculate on who the Beholder could be. You imagine him as a Yoacor warrior-king, tall and strong, with wisdom and intelligence beyond mortal reckoning. With this image in mind you feel optimistic that he will aid your quest. However, when the black door finally swings open your hopes are dashed—the sight of him shocks you to the core.
1
93,
318,Before you lies a vast sea of grey-brown dust that stretches to the cloudy horizon. It is a drear and haunting panorama: a land once rich and fertile murdered by the curse of chaos. It instils in you a dread uncertainty that deepens as you trudge each weary mile from boulder to crag, and from crag to dry scrub—the only landmarks in this desert of desolation. You fight your growing despair, drawing strength from your vow to complete your quest. For the fate that has befallen Guakor will befall Sommerlund if you fail to find the last Lorestone and return to Magnamund to defeat Darklord Gnaag.It is during your third stop for rest that you hear a noise in the silent wilderness. It comes from a group of tall boulders to your left. Immediately you rise to your feet and unsheathe a weapon as a huge but emaciated reptile, as grey as the dust, slinks slowly into view.
2
109,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
227,If you do not possess this skill, 
319,Suddenly a chilling scream, like the baying of a crazed wolf pack, echoes from the trees on either side of the bridge, and lumbering hordes of twisted shapes stagger from the shadows. They appear to be neither animal nor human but a ghastly fusion of the two. The Ookor guards tremble with fear and whisper the word ‘Agtah' as the monstrosities hurl themselves at the chariots. A dog-headed creature with two mouths claws its way onto the platform and launches itself at your unprotected legs.The creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Owing to the speed of its attack, reduce your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 points for the first two rounds of combat (unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery).
1
201,If you win the combat, 
320,A lever operates the portal and, when you pull it, the circular hatch creaks open and a shaft of grey light washes over your head and shoulders. Your senses burn with expectation. You grip the rim and start to pull yourself through the hole, but a dark shadow and a cold wind sweep over you, making you flinch and fall back on the stairs. There is a loud crack, like a sharp clap of thunder; then a terrible scream of agony echoes through the forest. Fear and anger grip your senses as you realize that you have just heard the dying scream of Odel, your guide. Enraged, you leap for the portal and pull yourself onto the roof, where the Lorestones and an unexpected enemy await you.
1
200,
321,You shout to T'uk T'ron that you sense danger ahead, but a rack of spears has worked loose from its mounting and in his struggle to tie it down, he does not hear your warning. You are now fast approaching the bridge and the driver shows no intention of slowing down.
3
266,If you wish to grab the reins and steer the horses away from the bridge, 
33,If you wish to pull the brake lever, 
137,If you decide to shake T'uk T'ron by the shoulder and repeat your warning, 
322,Swiftly you draw an Arrow and take aim at one of the creature's eyes. But instinctively it senses danger and twists its head furiously from side to side to spoil your shot.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, be sure to add the appropriate bonus as well as any other missile bonuses.
2
105,If your total is now 8 or less, 
286,If it is 9 or more, 
323,As you move away from the sarcophagus you hear the faint sounds of battle coming from beyond the tomb door. You run back along the corridor and press your ear to the cold stone: the faint sounds become more distinct. The clash of swords and the angry cries of Meledorian voices excite your curiosity, prompting you to climb the stairs to the roof to find out exactly what is going on.
1
27,
324,The sickness and nausea begin to subside but they are replaced by a fearful numbness that drains the strength from your limbs. Odel's face and the dark canopy of branches swirl and grow dim as the deadly poison paralyses your heart. Painlessly you slip into the timeless oblivion of death.
0
325,Your Kai skill enables you to comprehend their curious language. They are demanding to know your name and your reason for wanting to enter the city of Thas, and they warn you that they will call out the city guard and arrest you if you do not give them the information they require. You tell them that you have come from the Beholder of Yanis and that you seek she who is called Serocca. Immediately upon hearing her name the two guards order that the gate be re-opened. The portal of grey stone swings back and they beckon you to enter. As you pass beneath the archway, a dozen of their kind gather round you, chirruping and twittering excitedly.‘Come,' says one of the guards, pointing to the tower. ‘We will escort you to Serocca.'
1
86,
326,Your shaft clips his neck and rips open a line of chainmail links before arcing over the parapet of the roof. Blood oozes thickly from his wound and the force of the Arrow stuns him momentarily, but it does not prevent him from scooping the Lorestones into a small velvet sack, which hangs from his sword belt. Quickly you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon and rush forward, determined to prevent his escape.
1
97,
327,From out of the gloom emerges a colossal form: the monstrous, pear-shaped head of a giant sewer snake. It rears up from the narrow tunnel and fixes you with its burning yellow eyes, its forked tongue flickering to within inches of your chest. Its slit pupils dilate and you barely have time to draw a weapon before it strikes:This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
70,If you win the combat, you continue up the stairs towards the surface: 
328,Instinctively you try to deflect the blast of energy with the silver rod you are holding, but your reactions are a fraction too slow and the fiery bolt of power hits you and rips open your chest. Death is instantaneous.
0
329,Under cover of the thick, black smoke generated by the creature's breath, you stalk forward, weapon in hand, determined to strike before it can muster enough bile to fuel a second gout of flame. The beast does not expect such a bold move and you are able to creep within striking distance of its vulnerable eyes.This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).
1
265,If you win the combat, 
330,Stealthily you move through the tangled undergrowth to arrive at the edge of the road at a spot opposite the Meledorians, whom you can hear talking in hushed tones in a language you find easy to understand. They are speculating on what has become of you and your chariot escort, now long overdue. You notice that each warrior carries a small crossbow attached by a metallic sleeve to his right forearm. The sight of these weapons, which can be fired in an instant, convinces you that it would be wise not to startle these scouts.
3
52,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and wish to call to them telepathically, 
242,If you wish to shout who you are without revealing your position, 
15,If you wish to emerge from the bushes with your hands above your head, 
331,You reach the vault, only to discover that the door is split wide open and the walls are crawling with a swarm of loathsome, rat-like abominations. They squeal and gnash their sharp teeth furiously as they latch on to your scent.
3
2,If you possess a Fireseed and wish to throw it, 
298,If you decide to run back to the Grand Sepulchre and attack the three creatures that block the entrance, 
187,If you wish to draw a hand weapon and fight these rat-like horrors, 
332,You leap from the open back of the chariot and land feet-first on the bank. The ground is soft but there are many boulders embedded along the river's edge, and as you roll down the slope, you cannot avoid colliding with some of them.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, deduct 2 from the number you have picked.If your total is now 3 or less, lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.

1
165,Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> before 
333,You aim at his heart and let fly your shaft, but he senses he is at risk and twists aside, hoping that your Arrow will strike askew and be deflected by his highly polished mail.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add to it any missile bonuses you may have.
3
45,If your total is now 0-4, 
263,If it is 5-8, 
287,If it is 9 or more, 
334,Outside the wind howls like a horde of demons. It whips the sand into whirling cyclones that perform an erratic dance of destruction upon the plateau. You watch this awesome spectacle until the fatigue of your ordeal finally catches up with you (you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Unable to resist any longer, you close your eyes and drift off into a restless sleep.
1
112,
335,You pound across the weather-worn planks towards the middle of the bridge only to encounter T'uk T'ron and the driver scurrying towards you. ‘Go back!' he cries. ‘Go back…must save chariots or we all die here!'
3
273,If you wish to help T'uk T'ron defend the chariots, 
176,If you decide to stay in the middle of the bridge and attempt to repair the hole, 
10,If you wish to abandon the Ookor and escape across the bridge on foot, 
336,The force of the attack leaves you breathless with fright. The shadowy riders sense your morbid fear and emit a terrible laugh, cruel and heartless, as they move to surround you. You sense an impending storm and the feeling is heightened by the roiling clouds of the Neverness.
2
270,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge, 
41,If you do not possess this skill or do not wish to use it, 
337,The guards scowl and wave their arms fitfully. Then the gate creaks open and a horde of ape-men, brandishing spears and swords with sharp crystal blades, rush forward and surround you. Instinctively you reach for a weapon, but the points of their spears dissuade you from unsheathing it. Reluctantly you raise your hands and allow them to march you into their city under heavy guard.
1
86,
338,You sprint into the forest, thankful that the canopy of twisted branches offers good protection from an air attack. Only when you are sure that it is safe do you stop to catch your breath and check your equipment. To your dismay you discover that the creature's attack ripped open your Backpack and several items have fallen out during your escape.Erase from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> one Special Item of your choice, and those Backpack Items which you have noted first and third on your list.
1
138,To continue, 
339,With consummate accuracy you send an Arrow whistling into the treetops. It ends its flight buried feather-deep in the scaly abdomen of an Agtah sniper. The beast gives a piercing shriek and tumbles to the ground, landing with a sickening thud near the base of Baylon's Bough.Odel praises your skill and rushes forward, half-crouched, to search the Chaos-creature's body.
2
91,If you wish to stay where you are and cover him with your Bow, 
178,If you wish to follow him, 
340,Although you heard no sound when the platinum door closed, you soon discover that it is firmly locked, and yet there is no evidence of keyhole, hinge, or bolt. After careful examination you decide that it must be held secure by a spell or some other magical device.
2
83,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and have reached the rank of Scion-kai, 
9,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
341,You draw back your golden blade and take aim at the Chaos-master's heart. But the closeness of your goodly blade screams a warning at this evil god and quickly he turns to face you. You strike a blow which wounds his side but misses its vital target. With a roar of pain the Chaos-master drops his club and clasps his side. Pain swiftly becomes rage and, with a vengeful scream, he reaches out to crush you to death in his monstrous hands.This being is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). If you possess the Lore-circle of the Spirit, add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of the fight.
1
47,If you win the fight, 
342,Your lightning reactions save your life: you twist aside to avoid the deadly bolt and it passes within inches of your chest, thudding into a tree behind. Instantly you drop to your knees and crawl rapidly through the undergrowth, lest they fire again at the place where you stood. You stop when you reach the bushes that border the road, for opposite you can see the scouts crouching nervously beside their mounts.
3
52,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and wish to call to them telepathically, 
242,If you wish to shout who you are without revealing your position, 
15,If you wish to emerge from the bushes with your hands above your head, 
343,A group of hairy, squat-limbed creatures step from the shadow of the trees. They are armed with crude spears, which they clasp in their ape-like hands as they approach nervously. They surround you in a wide circle and one of their number utters a loud, twittering sound. Then he narrows his eyes and tilts his head as if expecting you to answer his call.
2
309,If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the rank of Scion-kai, or if you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, 
108,If you have neither of these skills, 
344,Using your index finger you inscribe the symbols into the soft surface of the square, but, as soon as you remove your hand, the symbols fade. Suddenly a crackling surge of electrical power arcs from a slot in the portal's stone surround. It catches you full on the chest and flings you several feet through the air: lose 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.
1
25,If you survive this severe shock, 
345,Serocca blinks away her tears and forces herself to concentrate on the matter in hand. Again the image fades from the table and a new one takes its place: a picture of forested hills and steep-sided valleys. ‘This is where the Lorestones emerged from the Shadow Gate,' she says, her voice now calm and controlled. ‘I detected their presence immediately, for the power they radiate is extraordinary.'‘Where is this place?' you ask.‘It is the Nahgoth Forest, close to the border with Meledor. I estimate that the Lorestones lie within a few hundred yards of Tolakos, the ancient burial ground of the Meledorians,' she replies, but with caution in her voice.‘Is this not good news?' you ask, relieved to know at last where the objects of your quest are situated.‘Yes, it is, but for the struggle now taking place in the region. The Meledorians are locked in battle against the forces of the Chaos-master, who is determined to claim all of the Nahgoth for himself. Tolakos is but a few leagues from where the fighting is fiercest.'‘Then I must retrieve the Lorestones quickly,' you say, rising from your seat in your eagerness to press on with your quest.‘Indeed you must, but it would benefit you nought if you were to reclaim them and then be unable to return to your home world for the lack of knowing where to go. Be patient a little longer, Lone Wolf, and I shall show you where, in all this vast region of the Daziarn, you can find the one Shadow Gate that leads to Magnamund.'
1
262,
346,You grab the jewelled hilt and are about to hurl it away when you notice that its curvy blade is engraved with a spectacular fiery dragon. At once you recognize the design and your hopes of retrieving the last Lorestone are suddenly revived. It is identical to the symbol you first saw in the Table of Visions: the mark that emblazoned the stone gate of Haagadar.You focus your Kai skills on the blade and they confirm your suspicions. The scarlet warrior came from Haagadar, and it is to that distant city that his black-winged mount is now returning with the last Lorestone of Nyxator.
1
246,
347,You project a psychic message which proves successful: the leader acknowledges your contact and replies using a mind language you can both understand. You tell him of your fall through the Shadow Gate and your flight from the storm, and in return you learn that he and his brothers are Yoacor hunters from the city of Yanis.<i>Come, we will take you to our realm,</i> he says, the words forming clearly in your mind. <i>You must tell of this journey to the Beholder. He will divine its worth.</i>He beckons you to approach his dragonmount and you step forward. The thought of being left marooned in this wilderness is all you need to persuade you to obey his command.
1
205,
348,The other chariots draw to a halt behind and T'uk T'ron's chariot is hauled out of the mud. Within minutes you are back on the road, close to the approach ramp to the bridge. Looking ahead, you notice that the centre of the bridge is damaged. Some of the planks have been torn up and strewn across the surface at random, crudely disguising a gaping hole. Quickly you point out the damage to T'uk T'ron.
2
69,If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have reached the Kai rank of Tutelary or higher, 
196,If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, 
349,The fearsome Zhengha swoops low over your position, raising a cloud of dust that fills your nose and eyes with grit. You cough and blink the dust away and, as the cloud begins to settle, you see that you have attracted the beast's attention. It has landed nearby and is poised to exhale its fiery breath.Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus or Huntmastery, add 4 to the number you have picked. (If you possess both Disciplines, you may only add 4 to the number you pick.)
2
310,If your total is now 0-5, 
49,If it is 6 or more, 
350,Vonotar lies dead on the black marble floor, his torn body oozing a blood that is thin and vile, like poisonous venom. You roll his corpse aside and take up the Lorestone in your trembling hands. Instantly an overwhelming wave of power is transfused into your being and you feel lifted, in mind and body, to a level of consciousness that transcends your mortal frame. You surrender to its power and under its guidance you are drawn inexorably towards the arch of the Shadow Gate. Willingly you step into the darkness and begin your triumphant return to the world where you were born.Your quest has succeeded, for the essence of the remaining two Lorestones is now one with your body and spirit. But the final struggle has yet to be won, for the power of your mortal enemies—the Darklords of Helgedad—has waxed and grown strong during your time in the Daziarn. If you possess the courage of a true Kai Master, the ultimate battle awaits you in the final episode of the Magnakai quest, entitled:<a href="../../lw/12tmod/title.htm#title"><cite>The Masters of Darkness</cite></a>We have taken our unique opportunity to correct errors and to enforce a standard of English usage.
